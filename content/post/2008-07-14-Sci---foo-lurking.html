<div> <p>I'm a Sci-Foo lurker, as I didn't make the cut to go this year, but I'vebeen lapping up the news seeping out of the meeting. So far my favoriteTwitter post about the meeting comes from Richard Ackerman's feed:</p><p>&quot;Timo and Tim are trying to kill us. Doesn't cult brainwashing start withsleep deprivation? Fun so far, anyway&quot;</p> <p>   </p> </div>

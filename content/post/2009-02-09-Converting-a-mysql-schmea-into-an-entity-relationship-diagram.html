<br />You will need to install XML support as a ScriptingAddition for script editor. You can get this from <br />http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/XMLTools2/. Quit and restart script editor after you have installed the extension. I found that when I was trying to compile the code script editor gave me a syntax error before I installed the extension. The syntax error dissapeard after I installed the extension, but the extensions themselves didn't work until I restarted script editor. <br /><br />http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=1860<br />

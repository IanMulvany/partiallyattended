# 212 climbing review. 

OK, time to review the year. I wrote out some [goals][go] at the start of last year.

## Goals for 2012 were

 * remain injury free (__not done__)
 * significantly reduce the amount of alcohol that I consume (__done__)
 * fall off at least 10 routes of 6c or harder/month (__not done__)
 * redpoint 7a, but don't stop trying harder things (__not done__)
 * get three campus board sessions or power hand sessions into my training per month (__done__)

My training diary from 2011 looked like:

And for 2012 it looked like:

There were two large disruptions to my climbing this year:

- [I was diagnosed with Dupteron's contracture][dc], leaving a three month gap where I did no climbing.
- I had a wonderful baby son.

The key effects were that I prioritised away from routes to bouldering for the second half of 2012. It also meant that I had far fewer trips out than in previous years, with only a few short day trips in January, and one afternoon trying a famous bouldering problem in Edinburgh. 

I also bought a beastmaker 1000, and started to use it regularly.

In 2011 my bouldering tally looked like:

total ~ 250  
v3 - 55  
v4 - 8  
v5 - 0  

And in 2012 it looked like:

total - 322  
V2	86  
V3	90  
V4	19  
V5	2  

## Climbing highlights

- born free in Swanage, fr 6b+, one of the best lines I've ever climbed. I tried it in 2011, and didn't get it clean. This time I didn't feel as strong on the route, but I knew what was coming and I did it.
- making real progress in my bouldering

## Goals for 2013

I guess it's time to set some goals. I'll try and use SMART metrics this time - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely. The main trip that I have planned for 2013 will be a trip to font, so that also provides a good anchor for goals for this year. I'll also try to tie long term goals for 2013 with "now-actions" that move me towards those long term goals. 

### SMART goals for 2013

- 520 boulder problems
- one fingerboard session/week for weeks where I am at home
- [La Marie Rose][lmr]
- climbing [Inner City Riots][icr]
- Try font 6b/6c and 7a problems when in font.
- redopiont 7a+ indoors
- read "[Better Bouldering][bb]" by John Sherman
- get away for one climbing trip to Switzerland with Daniel
- climb a Dream of White Horses

### Long term goals with now-actions

- Climb V6	| try V4/V5 problems every month for the first six months of 2013
- Get to 79 kg | get to 80 kg by the end of Jan
- Climb 520 boulder problems in 2012 | climb 40 boulder problems in Jan

I've been working with lean value tree as a framework for some time now, but there are few online resources about this. The linked presentation does a great job of giving an overview of the tool. In particular I like how they call out the need to describe the promise of value to the customer, something that we could definitely do more of. 

Another presentation on the same topic is this one: https://www.slideshare.net/steve236/lean-value-tree-overview-82783795

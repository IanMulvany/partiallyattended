It&#39;s a non conformist  <br>graveyard just off of moorgate in London. Over the course of it&#39;s  <br>active life over 120,000 people were buried there, in a space a little  <br>under four acres. Notable residents include Daniel Defoe and William  <br>Blake, but the occupant I was most intrigued to see was Thomas Bayes,  <br>the founder of Bayseian statistics. The large tomb contains  <br>thebesmains of many members of the Bayes family. It reminded me of a  <br>time when I passsed by the grave of Stokes on a graveyard in  <br>Edinburgh, also old and greened and sentinalled by ancient trees. So  <br>many great minds have fed the soil of this little island.

Back in November of last year we ran the first scholarly comms meetup with a focus on product management. There are lots of great meetups out there for people who work in scholarly comms, but we felt that there might be an unscratched need to have a meeting where the focus was not explicitly on community building, or on new technologies, or on public outreach, or on new trends and technologies, but solely on the product management work that is required to develop these kinds of tools. 

We hoped we could get people together to chat about war stories, share experiences, and in a friendly and encouraging environment open up about the common difficulties that we encounter in attempting to create high quality services for academics. The event went really well, and after it happened we said we hoped that we would do it again. 

We it’s back!, and this time we have a focussed topic: GDPR and it’s implications on product management in the scholarly communication space. 

If you are in London please join us on the **1st of May** at the SAGE offices. The event is super informal, a few speakers cover some topic of interest, and then we chat over pizza and beer.  

We are space limited, so you can get a ticket by signing up at our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/londons-scholarly-tech/events/249629141/).

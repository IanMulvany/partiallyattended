Documentation on getting a google wave robot written in python working with the Cron functionality is still a little sparse. <br /><br /><br />Getting a cron job into the capabilities.xml file. <br /><br />Add the following directive to the main function of your python program:<br /><br />    myRobot.RegisterCronJob('/path',60)<br /><br />When you look at you capabilities.xml file you should now see a new node in the file:<br /><br /><w:crons> <br />  <w:cron path="/path" timerinseconds="60"/> <br /></w:crons> <br /><br /><br /><br />

<div><br />        <p><span class="Apple-style-span">My colleague Gavin Bell just uploaded a great presentation about creating communities of readers out of readers of books. You can see his presentation &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gavin/gavin-bell-from-readers-of-books-to-a-community-of-readers-oreilly-toc08/" target="_blank">http://www.slideshare.net/gavin/gavin-bell-from-readers-of-books-to-a-community-of-readers-oreilly-toc08/</a>&quot;&gt;here on slideshare&lt;/a&gt;. He gave this talk at the Tools Of Change conference in New York earlier this month.</span></p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/a-great-presentation-about-books-and-community.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398df1fac0004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

<div><br />        <p>So the question of the day is if Hillary Clinton becomes<br /><br />Vice-President, would she be more or less evil than Dick Cheney?<br /><br />Now Dick Cheney is evil Inc. but the guy has never really pretended to<br /><br />be anything that he isn't, whereas Hillary would obviously<br /><br />lie and make policy in any way possible to win votes, which means that<br /><br />though she might not be as intrinsically as evil as Dick Cheney, she<br /><br />might make as bad a VP as him.</p><br /><br /><p>I think that she probably wouldn't be as actively evil as Dick Cheney,<br /><br />but sadly she is beginning to point in that direction.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/question-of-the-day-evil-vice-presidents.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398f807080005?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

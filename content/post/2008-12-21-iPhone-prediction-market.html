<div><br />        <p>Well, a prediction about a new market that will spring up (perhaps it<br /><br />already has) around the iPhone. So it costs $99 dollars to get an app that<br /><br />you have built onto the phone through the App Store. If I design a vanity<br /><br />app I'm not going to want to pay that much, but I might pay 5, 10 or even 15<br /><br />dollars to see the child of my creativity bouncing around on the little<br /><br />device. Some dev shop is going to offer to use their app key to load other<br /><br />people's apps to the App store for sure.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/iphone-prediction-market.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48ce1f01e0002?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

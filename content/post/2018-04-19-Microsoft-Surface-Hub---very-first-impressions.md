I just had my first hands on experience with the Microsoft surface hub. I tried out sketching a lean canvas on the surface to see how it would work. 

### Things I liked 
* writing was responsive 
* pressure sensitivity worked well
* two people can write at the same time 
* there is sketch to shape recognition, and it’s OK
* its just about big enough to work on, but bigger would be better 

### Things I liked in principle, but was not able to check whether they work in practice 
* being able to capture the output of the session digitally 
* being able to remotely work on the surface with another team at the same time 

### Things I didn’t like
* selecting and moving items really just was too hard to figure out 
* under / erase was fiddly 
* sometimes the built in grid would get in the way 
* when I had object recognition on, it would sometimes turn my “D”s into triangles 
* not as flexible as working with post it notes, in terms of being able to move and cluster ideas 

### Conclusion 

Overall this is getting there, but for me its not quite there yet. Many of the things that I thought would be natural interactions with the sketches that I created just didn’t work. I think the hardware is where it needs to be, but a few generations advance with the software could turn this from being frustrating to being delightful. At the moment I think trying to use this in a meeting right now would be more distracting than helpful, over the alternatives of just using paper artefacts.

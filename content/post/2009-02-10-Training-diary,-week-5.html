Saturday 1st<br>Snowboarding<p>Friday 7th<br>Bouldering at the castle<p>OK, I&#39;m a bit late posting this training update. Last week was the<br>snowy week in London, and I was lazy, boo me, however after not<br>climbing for two weeks and given the very poor training week I was<br>uncertain how things would go, which is to say I thought I would not<br>be very good, however my expectations were unfounded and I had a<br>pretty good session. In total 4 5c problems, a 6a problem with an<br>almost flash on another ( got to the last hold). A couple of weeks off<br>were not so bad after all.<p><br>Highlights:<br>good bouldering session<p>Lowlights:<br>being fuck ass lazy and not getting any running done, shame on me.<p><br>tags: bouldering, climbing, training

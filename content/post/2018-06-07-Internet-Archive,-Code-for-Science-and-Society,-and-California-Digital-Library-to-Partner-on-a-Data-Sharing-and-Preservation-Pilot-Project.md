Some major players are getting together to trial decentralised data sharing using the Dat protocol - https://datproject.org. Dat for me is one of the dark horses of the infrastructure landscape. It has great power, some amazing developers, has already created some great value, and is still not known by many people yet. 

Also, this is not blockchain based, and yet manages to be decentralised. Those of you who know me will know why that pleases me.

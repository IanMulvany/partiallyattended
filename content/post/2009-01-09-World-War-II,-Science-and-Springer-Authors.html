You search for terms or authors and it will<br />generate a google map with the locations for your search terms, or<br />people. The site also has some other infoporn, including a histogram<br />for authors published by year for your search term.<p>This box is along the right hand side of the page. From the default<br />home page there are two things of interest about this little graph.<br />This first is the rate of increase in the numbers of authors per year.<br />From a first rough look, it looks somewhat linear from 1948 through to<br />1980, and then it starts to speed up a bit. No real surprise there.</p><p>The other really interesting thing is the presence of two dips in the<br />numbers, one numbers, one for the First World War and one for the<br />Second World War. I've included a screen shot of the graph below<br />hi-lighting 1945.</p><p>I think that this data is historically quite interesting, as Springer<br />was founded in Germany in 1842 by Julius Springer, and as a result<br />their archive for those years is probably a good reflection of the<br />health of intellectual output from Germany during those times.</p><p>Springer also played a role in helping to rebuild science in Germany<br />after the first world war through the publication of some proceedings.<br />There is a nice letter of thanks from a number of luminaries in the<br />scientific community to Springer, you can see an image of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mulvanynet/149182658/">the letter</a>.</p>

<div><br />        <p>I just discovered this after poking around for an inordinate amount of time.<br /><br />The trick is to use Time::HiRes instead.</p><br /><br /><p>Now someone should write a bridge function that overloads the Time::HR<br /><br />functions with Time::HiRes functions which would make a code change as easy<br /><br />as loading the overload module.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/max-os-x-does-not-have-gethrtime-and-as-a-result-cannot-load-timehr.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48d02a6d80001?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

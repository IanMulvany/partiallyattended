I got asked to contribute an answer to an upcoming feature looking at trends in scholarly discovery. 

There are four questions and I’ve been asked to think about an answer to the last of these four. 

> In a sentence or two, please tell us what you understand is meant by 'discovery'?  

> For a researcher, how has the discovery experience developed in recent years?  

> How can researchers decide which tools are going to do the right job for them?  

> What is more important for researchers – the overall breadth of data coverage offered by a particular discovery tool, or the user experience?  

> With an eye on AI and machine learning, what developments are likely to be important over the next year or two?  

OK, what kind of trends might we see in AI / Machine learning over the next 12 to 24 months. 

For a start, in the very long run, there is significant potential for deep learning tools to help sort, find and analyse the entire scholarly corpus. This corpus is not large in the context of the kinds of data sets that machine learning tools are regularly run against (if we can but find a way to bring all of the content together in a normalised form — open access archives anyone?). 

There is a growing interest from scholars and funders around these kinds of ideas (there have always been scholars interested in questions related to the re-creation of the entire scholarly communication ecosystem. I have no doubt but that Hook, Newton and Liebnitz must have felt frustrated at the limitations of Henry Oldenburg’s innovation; in the 1940s Vannevar Bush outlined a compelling vision with the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex); the [upcoming ideas being proposed for the eLife sprint](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OzTaZ75_LyER0MgMjJUw83503CpV4KvrYoDROV8TZfg/edit#)  show that this spirit is alive and well. 

What I think is changing now is the power and availability of AI tools as a service are growing with things like [AWS Sage maker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) where you supply your training data and AWS generates a state-of-the-art machine learning model that you can apply in a simple batch like process. 

With all of the above in mind I have two predictions for how AI will affect search and discovery over the coming two years. 

We will see more new start-ups, or new tools like [Yewno](https://about.yewno.com) and https://www.sparrho.com come to market as the barrier to creating AI driven proofs of concept come down, however over that timeframe it will be hard to determine whether any of these new entrants will have real immediate impact on researcher behaviours. I would be shocked if some of these new tools don’t have a chatbot like interface. 

On the other hand, existing tools and discovery providers will continue to improve their algorithms, and refine the quality of their search results. Google scholar is already doing this with it’s “related search“ feature and Europe PMC just announced a collaboration with Unpaywall [a collaboraiton with Unpayall](http://blog.europepmc.org/2018/04/unlocking-open-europe-pmc-integrates.html). This latter is not directly an AI service — yet, but I predict that such classes of service will benefit from machine learning algorithms to help identify types of content.

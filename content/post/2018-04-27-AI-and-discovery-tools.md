I got asked to contribute an answer to an upcoming feature looking at trends in scholarly discovery. 

There are four questions and I’ve been asked to think about an answer to the last of these four. 

> In a sentence or two, please tell us what you understand is meant by 'discovery'?  

> For a researcher, how has the discovery experience developed in recent years?  

> How can researchers decide which tools are going to do the right job for them?  

> What is more important for researchers – the overall breadth of data coverage offered by a particular discovery tool, or the user experience?  

> With an eye on AI and machine learning, what developments are likely to be important over the next year or two?  

OK, what kind of trends might we see in AI / Machine learning over the next 12 to 24 months.  Well, my answer to that question is currently under embargo, but I’ll reveal all shortly.

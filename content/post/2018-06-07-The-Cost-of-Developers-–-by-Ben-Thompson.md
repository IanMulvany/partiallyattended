This is a fascinating post on what dynamics are in place between large companies and developers. The bottom line is that Microsoft has had to pay a large sum (>$7B) to acquire a developer friendly platform because they currently don't really have one. In contrast Apple has a lot of leverage over developers on iOS, but not on other platforms. 

I'm not sure if there is a connection to researchers in the STM space, but some journals certainly have a lot of leverage over researchers. Who is going to build the "researcher friendly" platform, how much will they have to pay for that, and will it be able to provide an ROI?

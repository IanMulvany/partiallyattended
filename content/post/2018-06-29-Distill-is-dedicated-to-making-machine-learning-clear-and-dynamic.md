Distill is an experiment in bringing interactive documents and scholarly documents together. I'm often asked what the future of publishing might look like, and were we to embrace what the web offers it might look like distill. 

Two things though, make it look like a nice product. Right now paper flow into this journal is very low, and secondly they have advertised a large prize to attract work in this format. Both of these indicate that there is not a trend of organic update of people wanting to create outputs for Distill.

Odd, it was working last time I used it. Today I got the following error<br /><br />git svn<br />IO object version 1.22 does not match bootstrap parameter 1.23 at /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/XSLoader.pm line 94.<br />Compilation failed in require at /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/IO/Handle.pm line 263.<br />BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/IO/Handle.pm line 263.<br />Compilation failed in require at /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/IO/Seekable.pm line 101.<br />BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/IO/Seekable.pm line 101.<br />Compilation failed in require at /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/IO/File.pm line 133.<br />BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/IO/File.pm line 133.<br />Compilation failed in require at /usr/local/libexec/git-core//git-svn line 40.<br />BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/libexec/git-core//git-svn line 40.<br /><br />The following blog post http://blog.grogmaster.com/2008/12/notes-about-git-svn-google-code.html seems to reference some kind of git-svn problem on Mac, though whether it is related to the issue that I am having I don't know. I've decided to try to follow the advice there and install through Mac Ports, which involves installing (dmg download available from the site). After that I tried<br /><br />sudo port install gs-utils<br /><br />For a laugh. I'm now waiting for all of the mac ports dependancies to load and install. I figure I've got about a 15% chance of this going through without breaking, given the current state of my system. I'm off for a coffee now, I'll check back later and see what happens.

<div><br />    <br />    <br />        <br />            <br />            <p>Last night I finally finished Neil Stephenson's Quicksilver. Oh, don't<br /><br />get me wrong, I've read it, and the full trilogy, before, but for much<br /><br />of the past year I have been re-reading it aloud to my girlfriend. She<br /><br />has an eye strain which means that if she reads too much at night she<br /><br />gets headaches, and so I've been doing the recreational reading for<br /><br />the two of us over the past year. We started out with Quicksilver, and<br /><br />made steady but slow progress through it. There have been some breaks,<br /><br />a small diversion through the worlds of Philip Pullman, a frantic dash<br /><br />through the last Harry Potter, but quicksilver has been the constant<br /><br />through the journey, a stable rock against which we could navigate.</p><br /><br /><p>There have been patches which have been hard to read out loud, many<br /><br />sections of the book include deep philosophical discourse between<br /><br />multiple characters, and when reading making clear who was saying what<br /><br />was at times a bit of a challenge, but we finally got to the last page<br /><br />just before midnight last night. Now just The Confusion, The System of<br /><br />the World and The Cryptonomicon left to get through!</p><br />        <br />    <br />                <p><br /><br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/a-minor-milestone-in-leisurely-reading.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a><br /><br /> | <br /><br />    <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48cf311a30002?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a><br /><br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

It reminded my of the cells ability<br /><br />to recycle old components.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/ikea-is-like-a-biological-machine.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48d0658700001?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

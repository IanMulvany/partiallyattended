<div> <p>I just got back from a wedding and bier festival thing in Munich. I've been tracking my weight on and off for the past year and a half with the ultimate goal of getting back to my climbing fit weight of about 80kgs. From the graph below you can see the spike that was caused by the extertions at the wedding!</p><p>(OK, in the vox rendering you can't really see the spike on the right hand side of the graph, but if you are bothered then click through and you'll see the original graph. btw the y-axis is a measure of how much weight I want to lose)</p><p><a href="http://www.bellygraph.com/graph/overview/300">&#160;&#160; <img src="http://www.bellygraph.com/graphs/271_300_large.png" /></a> </p> <p>   </p> </div>

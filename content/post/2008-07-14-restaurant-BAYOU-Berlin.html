On one ofthe last nights of the holiday we went to an amazing Cajun restaurant calledCafe New Orleans. I got chatting to the two owners and they told us abouthow they had been trying to sell their place in Spain and open up inGermany. Well the food was great, and the guy's running the place were superfriendly, so I was delighted to get this message as it's clear that theyhave finally made their place in Germany happen. If you find yourself inBerlin then you should definitely consider giving this place a try.</p> <p>   </p> </div>

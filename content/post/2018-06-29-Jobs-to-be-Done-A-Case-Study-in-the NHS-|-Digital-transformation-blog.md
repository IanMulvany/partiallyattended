This is a great post on using the jobs to be done framework. There are two specific enhancements that are discussed - how to weight those jobs, and how to use granularity of the jobs to aid the design process (less granularity gives more freedom in the design phase). 

The authors wanted to use surveys to get a sense of importance of the under served needs, but in the end had to resort to a simple variant of card sorting. They _still_ ended up with too much information. 

One of the big powers of the job stories was in using them to situate the use case (moving from the general to the specific).

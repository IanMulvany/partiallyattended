          <p>Discussing Open Access
<a href="http://discussingoa.wordpress.com/">http://discussingoa.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>I read through this piece by Rick Anderson. It&rsquo;s a very good piece. It does an excellent job of articulating some of the challenges of subscription publishing and of various forms of open access publishing.</p>

<p>I have a couple of relativly minor issues with it.</p>

<p>The impression I got from reading it was that OA advocates are more shouty and incapable of a serious debate on the issue than advocates of a subscription model, and possibly those who pursue subscription models are more open minded. I don&rsquo;t buy that. I agree that the behaviours that Rick points out do need to be raised, but I don&rsquo;t think there is a strong balance of rationality in one side of the argument over the other. I admit I could be wrong.</p>

<p>When I analyse how I come to feel this way I end up drawing from the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>subscription based publishers have attempted to introduce legislation restricting OA models. That speaks to an aggressive intent on that side of the argument.</p></li>

<li><p>Kent Anderson seems to be a troll, and by extension lends a trollish tone to the scholarly kitchen. One can argue whether he is a troll or not, and one can argue whether his arguments stand up or not, but the claim I make here is that his tone of writing will appear trollish to an unbiased reader. It ought be noted that I am am a biased reader - most of the products I have worked on in my career have received negative reviews on the scholarly kitchen, but to support this claim I point to the interaction between Kent Anderson and the editorial community of Wikipedia, in which it seems to me that Kent&rsquo;s tone led to more heat than light in the discussion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So to summarise, Rick&rsquo;s article is great, we should have more balanced conversations, but I don&rsquo;t think that one side has a monopoly on ideology.</p>

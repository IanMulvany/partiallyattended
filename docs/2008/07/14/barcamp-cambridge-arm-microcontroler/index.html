hard to use these processors, whanted to make something like this availableto normal peoplewant internet bluetooth connected devices
so they built something
he just plugged in a microcontoler with a wireless sensorhis machine things that it&#39;s a flash drive
he dregged over a binarythe device started blinking, this is the hello world of hardware hacking,cool
what can you do now? well cool stuff obviously!" />

It was outputting in degrees and minutes but needed to bein digital.</p><p>how does it compare to sunspots?</p><p>the main audience for this is people who want to add some control the theirdesign, but that it is not their core competence.For people who want to bridge the physicall world and the internet world.</p><p>could put an accelerometer in a rocket, and fly it for school kids. Change'fly' a rocket, and it's cool, to 'fly a rocket, and learn aboutacceleration'.</p> <p>   </p> </div>

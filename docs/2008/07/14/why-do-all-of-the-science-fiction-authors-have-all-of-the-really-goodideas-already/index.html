You would also probably have solved the meatto storage device transfer problem and the reverse. You upload a person,grow a body and download the person into the new body.</p><p>You could probably grow the body without utilizing breeding women (I thinkthis theme is described in the later Dune novels). This would also bedifferent from quantum teleportation, which is a ground up build from thequantum qubuits of a large structure, and due to decoherence it is a hardproblem to resolve. Molecules are more stable than quantum states, and soyou just need to knit a bunch of them together to build up a human body.</p><p>We can't travel faster than light. We just can't. So you upload yourpopulation, ship em off, and rebuild them when you find a suitable location.It might take a while, so you can send out multiple copies to increase thelikelihood of finding a nice new home.</p> <p>   </p> </div>

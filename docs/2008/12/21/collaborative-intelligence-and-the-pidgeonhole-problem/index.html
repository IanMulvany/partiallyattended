<div><br />        <p>O'Reilly are hosting a Collaborative Intelligence foo camp this coming<br /><br />weekend. There is some discussion bubbling out already on crowdvine at a <a href="http://cifoo.crowdvine.com/">group</a> that has been created for this<br /><br />meeting.<br /><br />One of the participants, Greg Linden, says the following:</p><br /><br /><p>&quot;Hi, Cass. Absolutely, this is called the pigeonhole problem and can be an<br /><br />issue if personalization is done poorly.</p><br /><br /><p>Done right, personalization enhances discover by helping you find things you<br /><br />could not easily have found on your own. Discovery in vast quantities of<br /><br />data is what personalization is designed to do. The key is to make sure the<br /><br />personalization reaches beyond the obvious and into the surprising. If you<br /><br />do that, personalization reveals the full breadth of the data and enhances<br /><br />serendipity.&quot;</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />and then</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />&quot;Hi, Cass. Sure, I think there are things that can be done. Most of this<br /><br />depends on the technique used for personalization. For example, if you<br /><br />implement recommendations by showing people items that match on keywords or<br /><br />from the same fine-grained subject category, you tend to get nearly<br /><br />identical items and little diversity. If you use user behavior, such as what<br /><br />people tend to buy together, you can often get more interesting patterns<br /><br />out, especially if you tune the system to try to reach further afield (at<br /><br />the risk of more spurious recommendations).</p><br /><br /><p>It's a great question and one that troubles all of us when thinking about<br /><br />personalization. We are filtering, but trying to do it in a way that focuses<br /><br />attention on interesting things, not that limits what people see.</p><br /><br /><p>I look forward to talking with you more about this at the conference!&quot;</p><br /><br /><p><br /><br />It brings to mind the idea that there exists a landscape in the search<br /><br />space, and what one wants to do is avoid local minima, but explore enough of<br /><br />the space to find related results that are not directly in<br /><br />the neighborhood of the item of concern. This means there must be a<br /><br />correspondence to the temperature of the system. Getting out of local minima<br /><br />can be achieved through an annealing process.<br /><br />Balancing relevance and serendipity through some<br /><br />constrained minimization process, like the one set out in the information<br /><br />bottleneck. How much better performance will you get out of these approaches<br /><br />over simple algorithms and what will be the relative computational cost?<br /><br />Does anyone know of any literature about this?</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/collaborative-intelligence-and-the-pidgeonhole-problem.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48cfbf4b70001?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

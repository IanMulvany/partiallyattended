<div><br />        <p>Mark Newman, Networks in Space,</p><br /><br /><p>This is about networks in geographic space.</p><br /><br /><p>Mark is looking at properties of networks that are tied to geography.<br /><br />Transport networks are a good example, and we are looking at the<br /><br />difference between road and air networks.</p><br /><br /><p>The road and air networks are very different, even though you use both<br /><br />of them for getting from A to B.</p><br /><br /><p>There is different bahviour, could I say 'driving' the use of these<br /><br />networks. For roads we want to minimze the length of our journey, but<br /><br />that's not such an important factor in flight journeys. When we fly we<br /><br />like to take direct flights, and minimize the number of flight hops that<br /><br />we take.</p><br /><br /><p>If you model this behviour you get out networks that look a lot like<br /><br />road and flight networks.</p><br /><br /><p>Their first model looked at connecting randomly distributed nodes.</p><br /><br /><p>In order not to get influenced by population density they made a map<br /><br />that is rescaled by population density. This is called a cartogram.<br /><br />You can see some really nice election cartograms that Newmann and<br /><br />Gastern made here: http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/election/</p><br /><br /><p>There is a really nice historical example from Raisz from the<br /><br />Geographical REview from 1943.</p><br /><br /><p>It looks like most recent attempts have been hand-drawn, but they look<br /><br />pretty shit.</p><br /><br /><p>Newman and Gastner made a difffusion algorithm that allows you to do<br /><br />this quickly.</p><br /><br /><p>OK, it looks like this started off as a network talk, but segwayed into<br /><br />a demo of this mapping technique. Ahh, no, we are back to looking at<br /><br />airports.</p><br /><br /><p>The interesting result from this talk is that the best covering fro<br /><br />utilities such as airports or post offices does not grow lineraly with<br /><br />popultaion, but to the power of 2/3.</p><br /><br /><p>This was also a pretty nice talk.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/networks-in-space-mark-newman-netsci08.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fa968230600003?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

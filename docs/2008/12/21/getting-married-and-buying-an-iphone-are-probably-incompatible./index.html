          <div><br />        <p>Having just gotten engaged and begun to look at the relative costs<br /><br />involved in organising a wedding I woke up this morning with the<br /><br />unavoidable realisation that the need to save for the wedding is going<br /><br />to make purchasing an iPhone, while I have a perfectly normal<br /><br />n95 that works rather well (especially since the broken key unstuck<br /><br />and started working again) untenable. My cunning plan had been<br /><br />to wait until the end of my current contract, at which point the new<br /><br />iPhone would be available, but the need to actually pay for the device<br /><br />in addition with my desire to invite rather a lot of people to my<br /><br />wedding means that I ought rather probably wait until after the<br /><br />wedding before<br /><br />I think about getting a new flashy gadget.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/getting-married-and-buying-an-iphone-are-probably-incompatible.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398f93c530004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

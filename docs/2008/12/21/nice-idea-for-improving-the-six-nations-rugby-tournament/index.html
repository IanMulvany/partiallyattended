I&#160;wholeheartedly&#160;agree. At the moment you get 2 points if you win a game, and 1 point if you draw. Under the bonus system you get an extra point if you score 4 tries and you get a bonus point if you are a losing team and you hold you opposition to a gap of 7 points or less. I think you also get more points for a win. I have only one improvement on this formula. You should get a bonus point if you are wearing green. I fear that this last rule enhancement is likely to be the only way Ireland will win the championship in the near future.</span></p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/nice-idea-for-improving-the-six-nations-rugby-tournament.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48cfc3e870001?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

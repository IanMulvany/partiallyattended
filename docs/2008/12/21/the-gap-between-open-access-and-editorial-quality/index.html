<div><br />        <p>I'm reading a great article by Joe Esposito on Open Access. You can read<br /><br />the article<br /><br />here:http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;cc=jep;rgn=main;view=text;idno=3336451.0011.203.</p><br /><br /><p>The article's main claim is that attention is the barrier to<br /><br />disemination rather than access. Another claim of this article is that<br /><br />paid for publishing platforms are good for readers in that they act as<br /><br />an attention filter.</p><br /><br /><p>One of the main claims of the article is that Open Content in a sea of<br /><br />other content will exist beyond the scope of peer review and editorial<br /><br />review. That is certainly the case at the moment for the most part.<br /><br />Beyond Google's search rank, there are few other effective ways of using<br /><br />machines to rank the quality of content, and certainly none at the<br /><br />moment that apply specifically to academic content.</p><br /><br /><p>I think that one of the issues is that the volume of signals about the<br /><br />quality of data that can be data mined compared to the data that needs<br /><br />to be mined is still tiny, and the tools to do this mining almost non<br /><br />existant. Social signals from tools such as Connotea are only just<br /><br />beginnig to create traces, but they are still small.</p><br /><br /><p>There is a hope that automatic data mining of sources will push out the<br /><br />need for manual editorial control, and there are platforms out there<br /><br />with enough computational power to do this, it's just that these<br /><br />platforms at the moment have much more important jobs to do.</p><br /><br /><p>Even when hardware and storage really are commodotized (and the<br /><br />existence of S3, EC2, AppEngine should leave no doubt in our minds that<br /><br />this is the way things are going), who is going to write the algorithms<br /><br />to review papers for us. Perhaps we only need a few people to do this,<br /><br />and so I shouldn't worry too much about that, but I still don't see this<br /><br />kind of thing happening for a few years yet.</p><br /><br /><p>There is another interesting aspect of Open Access that springs to<br /><br />mind while reading this paper.</p><br /><br /><p>The article does not address the machine redability of published work,<br /><br />and how restrictions on that type of access can hinder auto-mining of<br /><br />facts and figures, the aggregate results of which may command<br /><br />signifigantly more attention than the individual componenets.</p><br /><br /><p>Finally Joe has a nice little analysis of the kinds of costs associated<br /><br />with building new publshing platforms to market.</p><br /><br /><p>Alltogether I really liked this paper.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/the-gap-between-open-access-and-editorial-quality.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fad69023ff0004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

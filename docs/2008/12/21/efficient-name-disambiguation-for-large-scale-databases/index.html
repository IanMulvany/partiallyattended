<div><br />        <p>I've been interested for a while now in entity disambiguation,<br /><br />particularly where the e<br /><br />ntities are the names of authors in academic journals.</p><br /><br /><p>Jian Huang, Seyda Ertekin and C Lee Giles have a paper from 2006 in<br /><br />which they describe<br /><br /> the method that they used to diambiguate the CiteSeer data set of<br /><br />over 700,000 article<br /><br />s. The paper is &quot;Efficient Name Disambiguation for Large-Scale Databases&quot;.</p><br /><br /><p>They were able to use this algorithim to disambiguate this data set<br /><br />over three days int<br /><br />o just under half a million unique authors (though I didn't see a<br /><br />mention of the hardware nor of whether they used a linear or parallel<br /><br />computing approach).</p><br /><br /><p>Their approach seems to be to create an online SVM to bootstap a<br /><br />distance funtion. This<br /><br /> distance funtion can be trained using a number of types of<br /><br />information, names, meta da<br /><br />ta such as emails, and terms extracted from the associated papers.</p><br /><br /><p>They then block author names into groups based on name similarity, use<br /><br />the distance fun<br /><br />vtion found with the SVM and find groups of names associated with the<br /><br />same person by sc<br /><br />anning over the data using DBSCAN, which is a clustering algorithm<br /><br />that creates cluster<br /><br />s based on a minimal distance and minimal number of members. By<br /><br />slicing up the paramate<br /><br />r space based on minimal distance, rather than on an a-priori number<br /><br />of clusters, the a<br /><br />lgorithim is insensitive to a change in the number of points in the<br /><br />parameter space. Th<br /><br />is means you can use this method in an iterative way and it can be<br /><br />adopted to new data<br /><br />as it arrives. I'm remined of some papers in astrophysics that did<br /><br />clustering based on<br /><br />voroni volumes, but only in so far as the voroni method is vaguley<br /><br />related to a density<br /><br /> method.</p><br /><br /><p>All in all this looks like a nice approach to the problem, and the<br /><br />authors got 90% accu<br /><br />racy with their method, which is probably enough to bootstap a<br /><br />solution into existence.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/efficient-name-disambiguation-for-large-scale-databases.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fae8bdef7a000b?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

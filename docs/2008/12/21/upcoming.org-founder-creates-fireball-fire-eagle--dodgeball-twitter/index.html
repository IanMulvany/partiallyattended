I've been waiting for this to happen.</p><br /><br /><p>Sent to you by Ian Mulvany via Google Reader: Upcoming.org Founder<br /><br />Creates Fireball (Fire Eagle + DodgeBall + Twitter) via TechCrunch by<br /><br />Erick Schonfeld on 4/22/08<br /><br />Remember DodgeBall, the early social mobile network that languished<br /><br />after Google bought it? So does Leonard Lin, a founding member of<br /><br />Upcoming.org who recently left Yahoo, where he organized Hack Days. He<br /><br />helped write the code for FireBall, a clever mobile geo-location app<br /><br />that brings back the promise of DodgeBall using only other existing<br /><br />services with public APIs.</p><br /><br /><p>FireBall is a way for people to keep track of where their friends are<br /><br />on your mobile phone. It uses Yahoo’s Fire Eagle as a geo-location<br /><br />broker and Twitter. It is basically mashup of the two services, plus<br /><br />some functionality from Upcoming.org. People add all of their contacts<br /><br />on Twitter and authorize Fire Eagle to share their location with<br /><br />Fireball. “Instead of creating a new service that forces you to add all<br /><br />of your friends,” says Lin, “we end up using Twitter for messaging,”</p><br /><br /><p>When you want to find out where your friends are who have also signed<br /><br />up for FireBall, you send a message to a Fireball account on Twitter.<br /><br />You get back a text message with a Tiny URL link. When you click on the<br /><br />link, it opens up a KML file that launches Google Maps on your cell<br /><br />phone and hows you all your Twitter friends as pinpoints on the map. So<br /><br />your Twitter contacts serve as your mobile social network. You can also<br /><br />Twitter in your location. Simply mention a room at a conference, for<br /><br />instance, and it can pinpoint exactly where you are through integration<br /><br />with Upcoming.org,</p><br /><br /><p>FireBall launches today in a private beta for attendees to the Web 2.0<br /><br />Expo. The first 100 TechCrunch readers who are attending Web 2.0 Expo<br /><br />and send an email to “Fireballme+TechCrunch [at] gmail [dot] com” will<br /><br />recieive an invite. Right now, the service only works in San Francisco.<br /><br />CrunchBase Information Fire Eagle Twitter Upcoming Information provided<br /><br />by CrunchBase<br /><br />Crunch Network: MobileCrunch Mobile Gadgets and Applications, Delivered<br /><br />Daily.</p><br /><br /><p></p><br /><br /><p>Things you can do from here:<br /><br />- Subscribe to TechCrunch using Google Reader<br /><br />- Get started using Google Reader to easily keep up with all your<br /><br />favorite sites</p><br />        <br />    <br />                <p><br /><br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/upcomingorg-founder-creates-fireball-fire-eagle-dodgeball-twitter.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a><br /><br /> | <br /><br />    <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00f48d0f94850001?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a><br /><br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

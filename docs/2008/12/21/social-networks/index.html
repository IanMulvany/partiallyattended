          <div><br />        <p>There is a tension between the providers of social software, and the<br /><br />way we behave. When I move from one city to another my social network<br /><br />changes as that's very location dependent, but when I do have that<br /><br />network set up for the most part, I don't expect restrictions on where<br /><br />I can go in that city with my friends. For sure, some friends of mine<br /><br />might not be caught dead in the palace bar, they only drink in the<br /><br />stag's head, but I could drop in with my palace friends for a quick<br /><br />pint and catch up on news.</p><br /><br /><p>On the internet distance only affects us on the scale of timezones,<br /><br />and even there our tail of interaction is much broader. Our changing<br /><br />activities very much determine the networks we hold on to. I no longer<br /><br />practice science, but I'm still in contact with my old climbing<br /><br />buddies. However a big change at the moment is that the places we go<br /><br />on the internet still don't play well with each other in the same way<br /><br />that they do in real life.</p><br /><br /><p>I hope that truly mobile social networks will emerge, and I think they<br /><br />will be driven my our address books on our phones. First we will have<br /><br />real time tracking of the location of our contacts (to the point that<br /><br />mutual permission is granted), and then this will start to seep into<br /><br />awareness of location on the web. It's something that has been faces<br /><br />before, with IM and VOIP walled gardens. So far only email and phone<br /><br />numbers and physical mail addresses don't have this problem, and<br /><br />perhaps for that reason those will be the media that crack the problem<br /><br />first.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/social-networks.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fad690b0750004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

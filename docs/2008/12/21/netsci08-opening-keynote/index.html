          <div><br />        <p>Nicholas Christakis, Harvard, &quot;eat drink and be merry, the spread of<br /><br />health phenomena in social networks&quot;.</p><br /><br /><p>This talk is looking at the spread of desies throgh social interactions,<br /><br />rather than other types of interactins. The main study was looking at<br /><br />obesity using the Framingham Heart Study Social Network. This seems like<br /><br />a very famouse social network health related study, so I'm not going to<br /><br />go into detail about that, but the bottom line is that they were able to<br /><br />construct the social interactions from this study by digging through the<br /><br />huge paper archive. They were able to look at friend, relative and<br /><br />co-worker ties.</p><br /><br /><p>The main study was looking at about 5k individuals out of 12k, taken<br /><br />from 1973 onwards.</p><br /><br /><p>Nice, node ssize is related to a person's weight!</p><br /><br /><p>There is clear clustering of obese nodes in the network, now is this<br /><br />clustering random or structured?</p><br /><br /><p>Well, it's more clustered than random.</p><br /><br /><p>There are a couple of reasons why this might be the case. It could be<br /><br />that obese people like each other, people might be susceptible to local<br /><br />factors, or there might be some kind of peer pressure.</p><br /><br /><p>By looking at time evolution the hope is that they might be able to find<br /><br />'patient 0' for the obesity epedmic. OK, video is coming up now ...!</p><br /><br /><p>OK, looking at people getting fatter all over america from 1972 onwards,<br /><br />I'm going for a run later!</p><br /><br /><p>The effect is not centered in one location, but it seems that it's an<br /><br />epidemic that had multiple starting points in the network.</p><br /><br /><p>Looking at the directionality of ties of friendship helps you make<br /><br />inferences about causes. Wow, if you are friends with someone who is<br /><br />friends with you, and they get obese, you have 300% greater chance to<br /><br />gain weight. Stay friends with thin people!</p><br /><br /><p>It looks like much of this is driven by social norms.</p><br /><br /><p>They also have gwo data from the network, that is really cool.</p><br /><br /><p>They can convert location to wealth, and can take this into account when<br /><br />looking at the evolution of the network.</p><br /><br /><p>This data is really really cool.</p><br /><br /><p>No drop off in effect with distance, it is really the social tie that is<br /><br />important.</p><br /><br /><p>They also looked at the effect of smoking, and were able to take this<br /><br />into account.</p><br /><br /><p>So their working hyppothesis is that it might be the spread of behaviour<br /><br />and habit, perticluarly shared behaviour, going runnning vs going for a<br /><br />beer.</p><br /><br /><p>It might be the spread of an idea, the spread of what an acceptable body<br /><br />size might be.</p><br /><br /><p>OK, that's pretty amazing, and you can tease a hugh amount of<br /><br />information out of this study. Liklihood of quitting smoking, of how<br /><br />that is effected by education, and friendship tie.</p><br /><br /><p>I have to say, there is not a lot of results that are amazingly<br /><br />astonishing. They have food networks, like the bannana network and the<br /><br />friend chicken network.</p><br /><br /><p>They are also looking at emotions. We know that emotions can spread<br /><br />through groups, on diads. Could emotions spread hyper-diadically, and<br /><br />over longer time frames?</p><br /><br /><p>There is strong clustering of happienss, and your happiness seems<br /><br />coreelated with people who are outside of your direct social horizon.<br /><br />Interestingly happiness does not spread in the workplace (I think that<br /><br />was the point), but happy people have higher clustering and better<br /><br />centrality in the network.</p><br /><br /><p>There seems to be a half life for catching happiness from your network,<br /><br />this is about 6 months. There is also a strong local effect, you need<br /><br />happy people to be within about two miles of you, and to be having happy<br /><br />events happening to them every six months or so.</p><br /><br /><p>Ahh, you can look at smiling on facebook. Right, I gotta put up some<br /><br />happy pictures on my profiles!</p><br /><br /><p>Ahh, thiness also spreads, but the reason they have been looking at<br /><br />obesity is that this study is looking at the obesity epidemic. The<br /><br />network shows you the magnification of the phenomena, not the cause or<br /><br />origin of the phonomenon.</p><br /><br /><p>Interesting question, if you wanted to hire flight attendants who you<br /><br />didn't want to gain weight, should you hire them based on the bmi of<br /><br />their friends? Well, the answer is that in a workplace if a certain<br /><br />behaviour begins to spread it is likely to have a network effect. The<br /><br />flpiside is that you can use these network effects to more economic<br /><br />effect by trying to promote certain behaviour through targeting core<br /><br />groups in the workplace.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/netsci08-opening-keynote.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fa96818cc60002?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

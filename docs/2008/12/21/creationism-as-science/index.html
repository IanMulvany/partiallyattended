          <div><br />        <p>I'm at the netsci08 conference and there is a really delightful talk<br /><br />about the network of papers published in the creationisim/evolution<br /><br />debate.</p><br /><br /><p>The group looked at key people in the ID debate and people who acted as<br /><br />strong defenders of evolution. One can then make a graph of the links<br /><br />between the groups and intra-groups based on citation and co-citation.</p><br /><br /><p>Now one area of social science that is pretty interesting in this debate<br /><br />is looking at triads, as there are clearly going to be antagonitic<br /><br />relationships in this debate.</p><br /><br /><p>In the graph evolutionists are blue, creationists are yellow and Dawkins<br /><br />is red on his own.</p><br /><br /><p>From the graph it is clear that there are some people who are opinion<br /><br />leaders.</p><br /><br /><p>Ok, what is interesting is that there are far more mixed triples than<br /><br />similar triples in the graph, meaning that people from both sides seem<br /><br />to be spending more time slagging each other off than agreeing with<br /><br />their friends.</p><br /><br /><p>This is the first time that I would be tempted to say that the study of<br /><br />creationisim could be considered science.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/creationism-as-science.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fa968244010003?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

          <div><br />        <p>Yesterday the Guardian had a special pull out section dedicated to the<br /><br />LHC. If you browse through the articles you find lots of comments along<br /><br />the lines of</p><br /><br /><p>&quot;temple to mystery and imagination&quot;, &quot;a journey to the edge of<br /><br />understanding&quot;. &quot;a modern cathedral to our relationship with the<br /><br />universe&quot;, and so on. From the superlatives that are being written one<br /><br />would think that the LHC is the best thing to happen to enlightenment<br /><br />since some fat chinese guy sat beneath a tree, and that it is the summit<br /><br />of human imagination, achievement and art. Well, I just don't buy all<br /><br />of that crap.</p><br /><br /><p>Reading these articles got me thinking about what the LHC is, and<br /><br />fundamentally it's just a larger detector than what we already had<br /><br />before. As I see it, it's an inevitable extension of what you do if you<br /><br />want to measure something that we already know how to measure (particle<br /><br />tracks), with better precision over a higher energy range.<br /><br />The bottom line is that we have been doing this since the 1920's.</p><br /><br /><p>If you look at it as just being an artifact then it is neat, but there<br /><br />are many other piece of artistry that required as much imagination,<br /><br />effort, skill and chutzpah to bring together. The moon landings are one,<br /><br />the regularity of probes landing on mars another. The engineering<br /><br />required to make a large city like New York work always blows my mind,<br /><br />and that emerged from a bottom up self organization of 15 million souls<br /><br />trying to find a way to survive in an area of land a little too small<br /><br />for them all.</p><br /><br /><p>As we look around the world at the things we as a species have built<br /><br />there are many such artifacts that can inspire our awe and wonder. I<br /><br />don't think that the LHC can lay a claim to be at the pinnacle, though<br /><br />no doubt it is a good example of a big complicated object that make<br /><br />people look small when they stand beside it.</p><br /><br /><p>There is something to wonder at in all of this, and that is the idea<br /><br />behind the inevitability of something like the LHC. That idea is the<br /><br />atomic and quantum electrodynamical nature of the world. In that there<br /><br />is something to be proud of as a species. I don't see the LHC as being a<br /><br />radical departure from this idea, but rather an object whose existence<br /><br />is quintessentially rooted in that idea.</p><br /><br /><p>One could almost argue that the LHC represents a failure of the<br /><br />imagination. We are faced with limits to our ability to test the<br /><br />mathematics that we have written down against the atoms that we write<br /><br />with. We cannot tease apart the Fynemann diagrams to tell us more about<br /><br />the world, and so we resort to a bigger hammer rather than a more subtle<br /><br />approach that might look to other ways to coax the mysteries of the<br /><br />universe out of their hiding places.</p><br /><br /><p>There have been some papers that have come out recently looking for<br /><br />connections in the physics of super fluids with the imagined state of<br /><br />the early universe, the idea being that looking at the behavior of<br /><br />vortices in super cooled liquids could demonstrate identical physics to<br /><br />the phases of matter at the point of various decouplingings in energy<br /><br />scales. It's pretty clear that these models are yet toy models, but<br /><br />perhaps they point out an orthogonal direction to building massive atom<br /><br />smashers.</p><br /><br /><p>I want to be clear that I do applaud the work of the thousands of people<br /><br />working at Cern, and I do think that the billions of euro that something<br /><br />like this costs is more than worth the investment. I appreciate how hard<br /><br />it is to deal with systematics on something of this scale, and it is a<br /><br />minor miracle, but I just don't think that the artifact deserves unconstrained<br /><br />adulation over the ideas that is reflects.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/why-the-lhc-is-not-really-that-impressive.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00fae8c80373000b?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>

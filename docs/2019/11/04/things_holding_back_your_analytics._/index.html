          <p>One of my colleagues sent me over this short report “”<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/3-things-are-holding-back-your-analytics-and-technology-isnt-one-of-them">3 Things Are Holding Back Your Analytics, and Technology Isn’t One of Them</a>.</p>
<p>They think the following elements should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How the analysis teams are structured - they need to report in a way that is understandable (i.e. not be too separate from the business), but at the same time be independent enough to provide unbiassed views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to get the culture right, but to be honest the example given is almost information free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applicability of the models - the analytics team needs to create artefacts that can be used by the business.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They go on to recommend building an “”analysis nerve centre” with representation at C-Suite level - I guess where data can speak truth to power, or something. I do like their idea of creating “MVP” insight products, but this is advice is not much different from how one might approach other kinds of business improvements.</p>
<p>I think their advice on how to structure teams is something you can take or leave. I’m reminded of a talk I saw last year at an O’Reilly conference on AI about how to build data science teams. The gist from that was that you can go for a centralised or cross-functional approach.</p>
<p>The part though about jumping from a model to a useful model is critical, and that totally depends on the current capabilities of your organisation, the state of your data, and the lead time to be able to implement a decision.</p>
<p>On reflection my advise would be to think about how quickly you can take any data insight and validate whether it has helped the business. Anything at all, at even a small scale, will help you understand the context that you are working in.</p>

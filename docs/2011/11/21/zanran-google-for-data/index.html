          <p>Back in 2010 I was pointed at <a href="http://www.zanran.com/">zanran</a>, a search engine that looks for data in graphs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with some sample searches, and decided to try <a href="http://www.zanran.com/q/drowning_deaths_swimming_pool">drowning deaths swimming pool</a>. Incidentally all of the results that came back were figures for young children. I guess this is because that is the group where there is the most concern, and so there is more published data about this group.</p>

<p>There are some interesting broad figures that come out from the data:</p>

<p>Figures come in on average at about 2 per 100,000 population, or 0.00002%</p>

<p>This is about the same chance as drowning in natural water, but at 66% more likely than drowning in a bathtub</p>

<p>of drownings:
(natural water 25%)
(swimming pool 24%)
(bathtub 15%)</p>

<p>Cars are about 4&ndash;5 times more dangerous than swimming pools.
Guns are about 10 times less dangerous.</p>

<p>If you are a boy in Australia, you are more than twice as likely to drown in a swimming pool than if you are a girl. I guess that this is a combination of boys being encouraged to be more reckless and girls being supervised more.</p>

<p>Over a year on and the site is still up. It looks like it&rsquo;s still in beta, has more data than a year ago, and is registered in London.</p>

The Navier-Stokes equations:<br /><br /><pre lang="eq.latex"><br />\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + ( \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla ) \mathbf{v} = -\nabla p + \nu\Delta \mathbf{v} +\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{x},t)<br /></pre><br /><pre lang="latex"><br />\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + ( \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla ) \mathbf{v} = -\nabla p + \nu\Delta \mathbf{v} +\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{x},t)<br /></pre><br /><br />Describe the flow of an incompressible fluid. The equations are non-linear and are notoriously difficult to solve. I've always found them to be very beautiful and the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gabriel_Stokes">Sr George Stokes</a> was an Irishman probably had some effect on my taking to the subject when I was an undergrad. <br /><br />There are many subtleties hidden in the equations, notably the issue of conservation of momentum and the appearance of turbulence. The subject inspired the following rather fun ditty:<br /><br /><quote><br />Big whorls have little whorls<br />  That feed on their velocity,<br />And little whorls have lesser whorls<br />  And so on to viscosity.<br /><br />  -- Lewis F. Richardson<br /></quote><br /><br />When I was an undergrad I spent some time playing with a Cray supercomputer running simulations of fluid flow on a sphere. A supercomputer. A big one. In my grazing of the online new sources today I saw a link to <a href="http://nerget.com/fluidSim/">Oliver's fluid dynamics simulation</a> which provides a Navier - Stokes solver in the browser in javascript. It's pretty, and it's damn impressive. <br /><br />It doesn't solve the actual equations, but a diffusive model optimized for stability, speed and aesthetics based on <a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf">this paper</a>. <br /><br />It really shows the potential of the browser as a tool for the teaching of science. Being able to make changes to your code and test the results right there, nice!

<div>
          
Last month I bought some rail tickets online, and got to London Bridge only to be told that I had to go to Liverpool Street in order to print out the tickets. Five minutes before my train was due to depart. I had to buy a new set of tickets for that days journey, and get up extra early the next day to make it to Liverpool street to print out my tickets.<br /><br />This was really annoying me, so I wrote a pretty rude email and got a response saying that if I returned my tickets with a cover letter I would get a full refund, anyway, I'm about to send off for a refund, the cover letter is reproduced below:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><br /><br />09/03/2009<br /><br /><br />Dear Madam,<br /><br />I am returning the pair of unused tickets for a journey on the <br />14th of February 2009.<br /><br />I purchased these return tickets online for a journey between <br />London Bridge and Lingfield. When I arrived at London Bridge I <br />was informed that I had to go to Liverpool Street Station to print<br />my tickets, and that there was no way to be issued with my tickets <br />at London Bridge. I was forced to purchase another set of tickets <br />for journey on that day. <br /><br />The following day I had to stop by Liverpool street in order to <br />print the tickets for travel on the 15th, and in addition I printed<br />the unused tickets, which I am returning in this letter.<br /><br />The idea that you would create a system which allows for purchase<br />and collection of tickets via a web interface, but at the same <br />time not provision one of your busiest metropolitan hubs with the means<br />for retrieval of those tickets is astonishing. I understand that investment<br />in the ticketing machines may be large, but to roll out a system that <br />is so patently broken cannot be in the best interest of the consumer.<br /><br />At the very least, as an interim measure, providing tickets that may be printed online could be a viable solution. Every rail company that <br />I have travelled with across Europe has such a system. National Express bus<br />service has such a system. Even Ryan air uses such a system, which indicates to this mind that it cannot be too expensive to implement.<br /><br />Sincerely Yours,<br /><br />- Ian Mulvany<br /><br /></blockquote>

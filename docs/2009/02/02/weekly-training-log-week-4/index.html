A week snowboarding in Switzerland, 6 days total with a rest day on<br>the Wed. Pretty fantastic!<p>I didn&#39;t get any running done, and looking at the current weather in<br>London, it is looking like I won&#39;t get any running done this week<br>either.<p>My training summary for January 2009 then is as follows:<p>Number of exercise sessions = 18<br>Number of days with exercise = 17 (54%)<br>Total distance = 49 km<br>Total duration = 54 hrs<p>Overall the 4 week set at stamina training was not great, I just<br>didn&#39;t do enough. I&#39;m going to extend this one week more into the<br>first week of February, and the rest of Feb will be back to power<br>exercises on the fingerboard.

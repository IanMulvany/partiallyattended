I am working on a project where I have to pass some data from tables in a MySQL DB over to some people who don't use a relational database. The question is, how I can best extract the data in a way that is useable to them?<br /><br />I've decided to prepare the data for them as XML, as this prevents problems with<br /><br />My approach uses a hacked together collection of scripts, because, well, as Mark Pilgrim says, because fuck you. <br /><br />Actually, what I mean is they were just the fastest set of scripts that I could pull together for the task.<br /><br />It's a mix of perl and python. <br /><br />1st off, getting the data out of the DB.

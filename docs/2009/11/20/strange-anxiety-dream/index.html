          Last night I had a strange anxiety dream. I&#39;m not usually prone to<br>blogging this kind of thing, but it was pretty odd. I dreamt that I<br>had been given command line access to a particle accelerator that was<br>embedded in that antarctic ice sheet. I&#39;d run some kind of a job and<br>forgotten about it. Two weeks later I got a bill for &#163;216, 000. I&#39;m<br>not sure if that was the bill for the data that was generated, or for<br>the cost of the electricity for running the accelerator.<p><br>tags: dream, particle accelerator, antarctic

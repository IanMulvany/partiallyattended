Originally uploaded by Ian MulvanyI just got some great feedback on this picture from someone on flickr, it was taken back in February when I was on a skiing holiday in Switzerland. The house was built by my wife&#39;s grandfather, and we came to it, it buried in a drift, the air as sharp as the icicles. It was a magical week, and I&#39;m keen to return. At this time of the year thoughts turn to such things." />

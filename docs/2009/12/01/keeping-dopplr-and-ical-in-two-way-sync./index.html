          I don&#39;t know if the following is going to work, but I&#39;m going to try<br />it. Dopplr allows you to subscribe to your trips in iCal from a link<br />from the trips page. You can also publish a calendar locally to the<br />Dopplr servers that Dopplr will pull trips from. I&#39;ve set up two<br />calendars in my iCal, one for pushing into Dopplr, and another for<br />pulling all Dopplr trips from. I hope this will let me add different<br />trips to Dopplr via different mechanisms, and retain the connection to<br />the push calendar from iCal without breaking it. That just gives me<br />more options for getting stuff into the one place.<p>The best option would be to have complete bi-directional sync, I&#39;m<br />sure it will happen at some point, but in the meantime I&#39;m not going<br />to sweat it.<p>tags: iCal, dopplr, organisation

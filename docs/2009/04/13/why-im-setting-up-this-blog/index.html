Right, well, I'm pretty interested in graph theory. I work in publishing for the journal Nature on new web products, and I need a focussed way of getting my thoughts together on a range of topics that touch on science. I wanted a space that was more focussed than my <a href="http://www.partiallyattended.com/"> personal blog</a>.<br /><br />I have a few specific aims for this blog. <br /><br /><li>Get some of my thoughts on publishing, science and the philosophy of science out of my head and into an archived public space</li><br /><li>Make notes on any academic papers that I read that touch on my area of interests</li><br /><li>Motivate me to take all the cruddy code that I have lying around and push it public</li><br /><li>I'd like to use this blog as a driver to learning how to visualize and extract sense out of large graphs</li><br /><br />I'm hoping to perhaps get to grips to <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> as a means for the last of these three.<br /><br />In regards to the first of these three, I do intend to draw a dotted line between my personal opinions and bits of science that I find interesting, and projects that I am involved in at work. I like the <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Disclaimer">tao of mac disclaimer</a>, and I hope to tend more towards following this advice than not, however it is not clear to me that I would wish to refrain from commenting on aspects of the work that I do, especially those that reside very much in the public domain. <br /><br />That said, all opinions voiced here are strictly my own.

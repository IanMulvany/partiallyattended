I've been thinking about neat ways to make blogs approach research articles; about how to make some of the core features of a journal be more apparent in a blog, which has led me to think about blogger widgets. That led me to the <a href="http://phydeaux3.blogspot.com/">Phydeaux3</a> blog where there is a kick ass implementation of a <a href="http://phy3blog.googlepages.com/Beta-Blogger-Label-Cloud.html">widget to display a tag cloud</a> for blogger. Hopefully you can see that it works pretty well. Neat plugin. <br /><br />Hopefully I'll be able to dissect this to put in place some of the ideas I have regarding journals.

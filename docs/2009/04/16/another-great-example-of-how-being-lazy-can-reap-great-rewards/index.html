          Last year I got really obsessed with the idea of making my google email contacts list, my phone list and my desktop address book all sync together. I couldn&#39;t find a simple to use free application that would do all of this for me. For a while I was using Spanning Sync to keep calendars in sync. I had a Nokia N95, my desktop machine is a mac and my online life is mediated by Google. I thought about expending energy to write my own solution, and would think about it from time to time, but today I am happy to announce that I needn&#39;t have bothered. Now with my iPhone and &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html">http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html</a>&quot;&gt;Google mobile sync&lt;/a&gt; everything seems to just work, at least for the time being. I&#39;m pretty happy about this right now. <div> <br></div><div>tags: iphone, google, contacts, sync, lazy</div>

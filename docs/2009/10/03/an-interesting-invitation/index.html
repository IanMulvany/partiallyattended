Last week an interesting invitation popped up in my email box, I got a<br>message from Richard Sterling asking if I would be interested in<br>previewing the program that the government are rolling out as part of<br>their open data project. They have set up a google group for<br>developers, and I guess I&#39;m on the waiting list, or something. I&#39;m<br>going to be interested to see what data sources surrounding science,<br>funding, teaching and publishing will be available there. I&#39;m pretty<br>busy at the moment thinking about ways to improve Nature&#39;s online<br>offerings and make them more functionally useful, this might represent<br>an important path for that work.<p>The message says:<p>&quot;It&#39;s really important to us that you are all comfortable with what we<br>are doing and how we are doing it, so let us know if there is anything<br>we can do to improve things.&quot;<p>I like that, sounds like a good approach.

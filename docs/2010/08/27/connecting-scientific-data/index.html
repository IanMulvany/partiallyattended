          <p>I&rsquo;m going to be hosting a session at <a href="http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">science online London</a> next weekend, I&rsquo;m excited. I&rsquo;ve been interested in the issues of connecting scientific data for a long time.  In the last six months I&rsquo;ve become particularly excited about the potential of web based tool like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">Yahoo Query Language</a>.  I was hoping to talk a little about that, but I&rsquo;ve been lucky to get some amazing people to come and share their experiences about linking data, so I&rsquo;m going to cede the floor to them.  I might be able to get some YQL hackery into one of the unconference slots that will be knocking around.  Science online is shaping up to be a pretty awesome event, and you can check out the <a href="http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php">conference program</a> to see what you will be missing out on!</p>
<p>Here is the spiel and speaker bios for the section that I&rsquo;m going to be running:</p>
<h1 id="connecting-scientific-resources">Connecting Scientific Resources</h1>
<p>Do you have data? Have you decided that you want to publish that data in a friendly way? Then this session is for you. Allowing your data to be linked to other data sets is an obvious way to make your data more useful, and to contribute back to the data community that you are a part of, but the mechanics of how you do that is not always so clear cut. This session will discuss just that. With experts from the publishing world, the liked data community, and scientific data services, this is a unique opportunity to get an insight into how to create linked scientific data, and what you can do with it once you have created it.</p>

Having a discussion earlier today with one of my colleagues, we were<br>discussing pricing models for iPhone applications. I buy a lot of apps<br>on my iPhone, but the content that we were discussing pricing for is<br>academic article content. This traditionally sells online for tens of<br>dollars per unit. If one wants to sell such content on an iPhone, but<br>at the same time retain the apparent value of the content how do you<br>price it?<p>It&#39;s a tough question, and unless you have a large stable of journals<br>of differential quality, it&#39;s going to be hard to run a series of<br>experiments to test change in sales volume based on price<br>differentials.<p>My gut feeling is that to drive large, or even modest volumes, of<br>sales on a device like the iPhone the content has to be priced below<br>the level at which the buyer is even considering the economics of the<br>purchase. It has to pass my &quot;is it less than a cup of coffee&quot; test. If<br>it is then I&#39;m not even going to think about the opportunity cost for<br>purchase. Of course this is where it gets problematic for academic<br>content. You could only sell minor academic content cheaply (like news<br>coverage), or content with a reduced fucntionality, or you could try<br>and go for some sweet spot pricing (the cost of a large latte with<br>extra cream and caramel topping kind of thing).<p>The iPad is likely to allow academic publishers to go ahead and just<br>try to sell their content at the prices that they think they can<br>charge for on the web, but I&#39;d still love to see a radical re-think of<br>pricing for at least some types of content on handheld platforms.<p>tags: iphone, ipad, publishing, science, pricing, coffee

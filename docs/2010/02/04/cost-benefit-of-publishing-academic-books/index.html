Nature has just published an editorial (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7281/full/463588a.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7281/full/463588a.html</a>) promoting the idea of writing text books (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/463588a">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/463588a</a>).<br />Having worked for a number of years as a commissioning editor for a<br />major academic publisher, responsible for more that 20% of academic<br />book output, I have to say that the cost-benifit analysis for<br />publishing books ends up saying that it just does not justify the<br />effort for academics to write monographs. You probably won't see more<br />than a few hundred sales, citations to the work will be slow in<br />coming. Early career academics in particular are wasting valuable time<br />that should be spent on getting publications out. That said there are<br />three situations in which it might be OK to be involved in producing a<br />book:<p>1. You are at an advanced stage in your career and you want to codify<br />your vision of a particular subject. In such a case the work is a<br />labour of love, you have your laurels and now you want to produce an<br />artefact that synthesises your view on a topic. This is a highly<br />valuable exercise, look at the works of Chandrasekhar for an extreme<br />example of this. Of course, such an individual is going to go ahead<br />and do this anyway.</p><p>2. You have been instructing a class and have put together a detailed<br />set of instructional notes, especially for advanced classes in<br />graduate school. For a little more effort you can convert a large<br />batch of work that you have already done into another artefact that<br />can increase your academic reputation, go for it!</p><p>3. You are involved in a large consortium or working group. The act of<br />putting together a chapter for a book can cement working<br />relationships. What tends to be more important here though is the<br />collaborative process, more-so than the final artefact. The question<br />to be asked should be whether working with the given group of<br />academics is worth the time, rather than whether the final book will<br />be worth the time involved.</p>

Via Bruce Schneir&#39;s blog there is a link to a paper about a new<br>security system that credit card companies are rolling out; a single<br>sign on system. The paper is here:<br><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/fc10vbvsecurecode.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/fc10vbvsecurecode.pdf</a>. The<br>bottom line is that the system is pretty insecure, but it is<br>incentivised by making the customer sign up to additional terms and<br>conditions that puts more liability on them than on the banks or<br>credit card companies. It seems a bit like adding a shrink wrap<br>licence around credit card usage. I think I would not mind if they<br>were increasing my security, but as outlined in the paper linked to<br>here, they are not. I recently had to use this system, and it seemed<br>very phishy to me, so I avoided it as much as I could, but for the<br>time being it looks like there is not going to be a way to avoid it in<br>future. Fuckers.<p>tags: online security, banks, single sign on.

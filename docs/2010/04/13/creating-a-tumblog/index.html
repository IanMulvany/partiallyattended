          After a few conversations with @zzgavin, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion<br>that there is a place for a tumblog in the toolkit of those who like<br>to post content onto the web. There are often pieces of content that I<br>want to call out, but don&#39;t have either the time or the interest to<br>write a longer blog post about.  For a while I thought that would be a<br>good use of Twitter, but in the end that type of behaviour just<br>pollutes your twitter feed. Indeed, posting a link to an image is<br>never as immediate as posting the image itself.<p>This blog will remain a repository when I want to say something<br>coherent that is about 140 characters. My twitter feed will continue<br>to respond to the question of what it is that I am doing, combined<br>with it&#39;s use as a lightweight communication network. My tumblelog<br>will henceforth be an online digital clipboard of links, quotes and<br>images that tickle my fancy.<p>If you are so interested you may check it out at:<p><a href="http://attention-deficit.tumblr.com/">http://attention-deficit.tumblr.com/</a>

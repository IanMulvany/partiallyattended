          <p>(I&rsquo;m posting some of these posts a few days after writing, but you&rsquo;ll get that, won&rsquo;t you)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s five in the morning, and I&rsquo;m well and truly jet lagged, but after the past week this is not the strangest I&rsquo;ve been feeling so, it&rsquo;s not too bad (the immunisation shots for my trip to Mexico left me in an entertainingly woozy state Friday evening).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m over to cover the digital library federation meeting, and the satellite SITS meeting on thursday. I&rsquo;ve been sent along with David Challis from Douthhampton, and allthough we took the same flight we didn&rsquo;t meet up until we had both made it to the hotel here in paulo alto.</p>

<p>One of the good lessons that came up in our conversation over dinner was that if you running a system that produces a lot of metadata, then it&rsquo;s really important to be a consumer of your own system, because most of the other consumers of Thea system are not automatically going to alert you when there are errors in your metadata records.</p>

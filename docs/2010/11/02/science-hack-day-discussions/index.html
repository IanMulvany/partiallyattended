In an attempt to get over the jet lag, myself and Dave headed over to San Francisco yesterday, we had a good walk around, got lost twice, and then met pup with the lovely Ariel Waldman. I had to drop off some mendeley schwag for the upcoming San Francisco science hack day that Ariel is organising (we are giving a little sponsorship, yay!). It&rsquo;s going to take place in two weeks, and it looks lie it&rsquo;s going to be an awesome event." />

          <p>(This was from Sunday)</p>
<p>In an attempt to get over the jet lag, myself and Dave headed over to San Francisco yesterday, we had a good walk around, got lost twice, and then met pup with the lovely Ariel Waldman. I had to drop off some mendeley schwag for the upcoming <a href="http://sf.sciencehackday.com/">San Francisco science hack day</a> that Ariel is organising (we are giving a little sponsorship, yay!). It&rsquo;s going to take place in two weeks, and it looks lie it&rsquo;s going to be an awesome event.</p>
<p>These <a href="http://sciencehackday.com/">science hack days</a> grew out of a panel discussion that Ariel let at the last south by southwest conference. Jeremey Keith organized the first one that took place in London.  I was at the London event, and that rocked,</p>
<p>Some key things for hack days,  not too much sugar, keep the beer for later, near the presentations and find a good way to capture some of the context from which the hacks emerge, the description of the hacks from the London event are a good reminder if you were there, but not so great for people looking in from the outside.</p>
<p>We got chatting, and of course that just threw up a whole bun of people that both Ariel and know, she was about to have dinner that evening with argon smith, I&rsquo;d just met him two weeks ago in oxford, small small world.</p>
<p>After that Dave and I headed around San Fran for a bit of exploring (science fiction and fantasy bookshops, climbing walls, comic sea lions, and antediluvian coin operated fortune telling machines all featured in a rather event packed evening), then back on the cal train to our hotel and a minor battle with the jet lag.</p>

Reading though the excellent introduction to Kierkegaard&#39;s philosophy<br>in the Guardian<br>(<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/15/kierkegaard-philosophy-existentialism">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/15/kierkegaard-philosophy-existentialism</a>),<br>it is pointed out that one of the key underlying principles of his<br>philosophy is that we have forgotten what it means to exist, and that<br>the cause of this forgetting is the ever growing amount of knowledge<br>in the world (a state of affairs that is now ever more apparent even<br>than in his time).<p>I am dubious about this claim.  I think it likely that we have always<br>been forgetting this questions.  In the trials of agrarian society the<br>question is pushed aside by concerns of the harvest.  In the hold of a<br>religious society such questions are givens and not open to<br>inspection. It&#39;s always a hard question, and I&#39;m sure that modernism<br>causes it&#39;s disappearance more than any other state.  Of course I<br>could be wrong.

Looking back at my <a href="http://www.partiallyattended.com/2008/12/review-of-climbing-goals-for-2008.html"> goals for 2009</a>, I've not done very well, however my current level of fitness is pretty good, so I think 2010 is going to be a good year.<br /><br />The main factors in holding back my climbing in 2009 were taking a few months off to get married and not being able to rent a car. Getting married was absolutely worth it, and the level of organisation and stability I have in my life now due to being married will only help in the long run. Although I got a driving licence last year, I was not able to rent a car in 2009 as I hadn't my licence for long enough, that will change now in 2010, and I should be able to make it out and about around the UK to get some cragging in. <br /><br />So my goals for end of 2010 will be:<br /><br />- fr 7a redpoint indoors<br />- V5 (I've done a few V4's towards the tail end of last year)<br />- a font 6a in font, preferably <a href="http://bleau.info/cuvier/2128.html">la marie rose</a> (trip to font planned for April) <br />- Trad E1 (I've lowered this goal as I've had so little trad experience in the past number of years)<br />- A few trips to do some trad climbing.<br /><br />I just got <a href="http://davemacleod.blogspot.com/2009/12/9-out-of-10-climbers-has-arrived.html">9 out of 10 climbers make the same mistakes</a>, and I hope that will give me some good training motivation for early in the year.

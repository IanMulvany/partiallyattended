I just commented over on the digatilist:<p>I&#39;m in two minds, but on balance I&#39;m optimistic. What they are<br>delivering is not a product, but a new platform, and one who&#39;s<br>limitation has the potential to drive innovation in the open web. What<br>I really don&#39;t like about what has been delivered is how closed the<br>system is, and how much this is not a tool that a developer could use.<br>I am in no way the target market for this product, but I don&#39;t care<br>that I&#39;m not a market, I care about what I care about. The kinds of<br>things that I would want to do with such a device I can&#39;t do, however<br>applications on the web, in particular cloud storage + html 5<br>applications with local data storage, are fast moving to the point<br>where I could start coding in the cloud. My language of choice is<br>Python, there is already a toy implementation of a python interpreter<br>through a web interface (<a href="http://try-python.mired.org/">http://try-python.mired.org/</a>). The Mozilla<br>foundation have a really advanced cloud based code editor<br>(<a href="https://bespin.mozilla.com/">https://bespin.mozilla.com/</a>). Coding is about the biggest thing that<br>this device does not allow the power user to do. If those things are<br>close to being do-able in the cloud, then anything is possible.<p>What I do like about the device is the potential speed. We don&#39;t need<br>computers with fast processors. We need computers that feel fast. This<br>platform could really drive computer-human interactions towards the<br>cloud based model. It could really be a boost for rich web<br>applications (no need to go through the app store), and it could<br>really drive innovation in software and content delivery on the web.<br>It&#39;s almost a blank canvas upon which we may write or create the<br>interfaces that will define how people will interact with the content<br>or services we wish to deliver, and that&#39;s going to be a big deal.<p>tags: cloud, iPad, speed, web applications, html5

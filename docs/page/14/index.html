                    In order to check mail less frequently than the options available, following a hint from macosxhints:
 set up an applescript to tell mail to check for mail. put that script under a launchd deamon with an interval use lingon to setup the deamon  so far it seems to be working, yay!

                    I don't post my poetry often, indeed I don't write often, but I thought this one came out OK. Written over the past weekend for a good friend on the occasion of her birthday.

Edinburgh, first draft, 01/05/2010
for andrea.
Was it in Summer, when I lost myself among the graveyards?
The moss covered steps of Greyfriars green and gleaming.
Or was it someone's winter night along cobbled streets, where buildings wear a sharp puritan cut to their overcoats?

                    Here is a comment I've just posted to a comment thread about LaTeX over here: http://blogs.nature.com/farhat/2010/04/16/collaborative-editing-with-latex. One of the commenters asked "Why not just use a word processor"

Just using a word processor simply does not cut it when it comes to expressing complex mathematical ideas. LaTeX, and it's precursor TeX, have evolved to be the only tools that can currently express the richness of the ideas within advanced mathematics.

                    After a few conversations with @zzgavin, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion
that there is a place for a tumblog in the toolkit of those who like
to post content onto the web. There are often pieces of content that I
want to call out, but don&#39;t have either the time or the interest to
write a longer blog post about. For a while I thought that would be a
good use of Twitter, but in the end that type of behaviour just

Originally uploaded by gioia_On Saturday we went to a party thrown by some friends of ours. It was kind of a delayed St. Patrick's day party, and everyone had to bring along a potato dressed up as a celebrity, or some such.
We created our potato after the Father Ted episode "Competition Time", in which Ted, Dougal and Jack dress up as the three ages of Elvis. The third age in this little diorama is made up from mashed spud in a sock.

                    Reading though the excellent introduction to Kierkegaard&#39;s philosophy
in the Guardian
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/15/kierkegaard-philosophy-existentialism),
it is pointed out that one of the key underlying principles of his
philosophy is that we have forgotten what it means to exist, and that
the cause of this forgetting is the ever growing amount of knowledge
in the world (a state of affairs that is now ever more apparent even
than in his time).I am dubious about this claim.

http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGraphApi. I think it&#39;s great. The
discussion has actually been going on since Aug 2004, so I don&#39;t know
what the status of this PEP is. I would love to see something come out
of it eventually.tags: graph, PEP, python

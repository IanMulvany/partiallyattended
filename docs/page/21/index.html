                    I've been interested for a while now in entity disambiguation,
particularly where the e
ntities are the names of authors in academic journals.
Jian Huang, Seyda Ertekin and C Lee Giles have a paper from 2006 in
which they describe
the method that they used to diambiguate the CiteSeer data set of
over 700,000 article
s. The paper is &quot;Efficient Name Disambiguation for Large-Scale Databases&quot;.
They were able to use this algorithim to disambiguate this data set

                    I am, one might say, a bit of an RSS junkie. It has been the main source of
news and information for me for about the last year or so, but I began to
feel as if I was drowning in it. I subscribe to something over 80 feeds,
some of which, like techcrunch, spit out over 40 or 50 items a day. A few
days away from my feed reader and there could be well over 1000 entries

that is collecting shared documents of interest to scientists, I
believe. They are in the private beta stage, but had a link on their
homepage for requesting an account. I got the following message when I
hit the verification link:

I just discovered this after poking around for an inordinate amount of time.
The trick is to use Time::HiRes instead.
Now someone should write a bridge function that overloads the Time::HR
functions with Time::HiRes functions which would make a code change as easy
as loading the overload module.

                    Mark Newman, Networks in Space,
This is about networks in geographic space.
Mark is looking at properties of networks that are tied to geography.
Transport networks are a good example, and we are looking at the
difference between road and air networks.
The road and air networks are very different, even though you use both
of them for getting from A to B.
There is different bahviour, could I say 'driving' the use of these

                    I was in, of all places, Godalming, at the weekend and ended up
browsing in a book store for a few moments. I saw what looked like a
very interesting book, href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/0007256523/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211186399&amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Predictably
Irrational. The book looks at the processes behind bad or
irrational decisions. The author is an economist and it seems the aim
of the book is to help us to see the emotional effects that influence
our decisions, and that lead us to poor decision making.

                    The following paper &quot;Soft peer review: Social software and distributed
scientific evaluation&quot; was passed along to me by alf today. I think
another copy has been haunting my file system for a few days, but this
seemed like a good reason to sit down again with it.
It's by Dario
Taraborelli and the abstract is as follows:

                    So, I've been having some problems with the Vox service for some time,
and now I have a twine invitation, so I am going to test out Twine as
a platform for blogging.
The way I blog is that I tend to write up my blog posts in a mail
client and then mail these to the blog engine, but so far Vox as a
service has been soso.

                    I'm reading a great article by Joe Esposito on Open Access. You can read
the article
here:http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;cc=jep;rgn=main;view=text;idno=3336451.0011.203.
The article's main claim is that attention is the barrier to
disemination rather than access. Another claim of this article is that
paid for publishing platforms are good for readers in that they act as
an attention filter.
One of the main claims of the article is that Open Content in a sea of

fucked up formatting, I think my blog host vox is still being shitty
at recognising simple html formatting in input, mixed with line
breaks, it's just a frickin url link for god's sake) is a nicely
implemented engine for making 3-D graphs and plots. I installed it and
got the default python interface up and running in about 5 minutes. My
initial reaction was &quot;this is cool&quot;.

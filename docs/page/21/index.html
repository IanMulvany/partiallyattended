        You will need to install XML support as a ScriptingAddition for script editor. You can get this from http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/XMLTools2/. Quit and restart script editor after you have installed the extension. I found that when I was trying to compile the code script editor gave me a syntax error before I installed the extension. The syntax error dissapeard after I installed the extension, but the extensions themselves didn't work until I restarted script editor.

on. 7 leads, and at the end I was still finding it really easy, which

leads. Also did some nice bouldering.Sunday 18th

        A week snowboarding in Switzerland, 6 days total with a rest day on
the Wed. Pretty fantastic!I didn&#39;t get any running done, and looking at the current weather in
London, it is looking like I won&#39;t get any running done this week
either.My training summary for January 2009 then is as follows:Number of exercise sessions = 18
Number of days with exercise = 17 (54%)
Total distance = 49 km

        From Science of the invisible I picked up the link to the Read Write Web article on death of enterprise RSS. What is going on here? I'm working in the enterprise and I use RSS a hell of a lot. After trying a number of different strategies I now use Google reader, because it has the fastest way for me to get rid of content in the feeds. Why does the enterprise not get it?

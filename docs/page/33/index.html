        OK, so I'm interested in installing the Connotea code base on my mac fordevelopment reasons. It will be the first time that I am going to startplaying around with a largish perl installation on my macine and there are alot of perl dependencies to be installed. Rather than going through CPANmodule by module, and rather than writing a bundle file for the connoteadependancies (because I don't know how to do that yet) I decided to try touse CPANPLUS, due to the tips on perl administration withCPANPLUS

        A good friend of mine has just hit the 8a mark in climbing. Dave is a greatclimber, and a really nice guy, but what really blew me away is that hisfiancee Caroline led 7b on her first sports climbing trip.
One thing know about both of them is that they do a lot of running,something like 10 - 15 miles evrey morning.
If this isn't motivation for me to pick up running then I don't know whatis.

        I have a good friend who lives in Den Haag and passed on the followingadvice about places to go and eat if you have a small child. This is reallygreat advice so I thought I should post it here:
Hi Victoria,
Very sad to hear your friend has such a lousy experience in my country. AsIan can confirm, it's not a very easy place for 'outsiders'... The upside isthat if you are not at fancy free and footloose as my friend Ian is- andwith a little boy that age she will have moderated her dancing ambitions-The Hague can be quite a nice place to hang out.

        The similarity between magic and programming is never more apparent thanwhen you sit down and watch someone who is truly good on the command line.By virtue of having secret knowledge they can quickly accomplish theapparently impossible. If you start out in the unix world you begin bylearning some simple incantations such as 'cd', 'ls' and 'top' and 'kill'.If you persevere with the art eventually you may master the hidden runesthat bring 'sed' and 'awk' to life.

        I spent about half an hour trying to install the excellent Python ImageLibrary on my mac. It's one of those things that is more annying than itshould be. You get libjpeg from herehttp://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz follow the instructions here onhow to patch the makefile and how to install libjpeg:http://www.kyngchaos.com/macosx/install/libjpeg (all this after installingthe developer tools on mac), only to fail and then discover that there is aprebuilt binary package here:http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html which works perfectly.

        toscany activity spikes with R Originally uploaded by fgirardin Web 2.0 is a buz word. At a conference that I attended last week it came up frequently as being one of the most over-hyped terms around at the moment, but there is substance behind it, and how that substance appears is fully up to the creativity of people who are willing to get their hands dirty with the actual data that is being produced by social web sites.

        The new terminal is very nice, but I did a wipe and re-install and waswondering what had happened to my old terminal settings. Of course thedefault .bash_profile file was being used as the settings file, so I deletedit and now the terminal works as expected.

        The new terminal is very nice, but I did a wipe and re-install and waswondering what had happened to my old terminal settings. Of course thedefault .bash_profile file was being used as the settings file, so I deletedit and now the terminal works as expected.

        Arecent blog post on Action Potential pointed me towards the neuroscience peer review consortium. Theyhave a description here about theconsortium and a list ofparticipating journals. I have no doubt that this is the future of peerreview. At the moment the peer review system is horribly inefficient forpapers that get rejected. Rejection from a journal can occur because a paperis crap, but often it happens for many other reasons, because the journalhas already met it's pagequota, the journal is publishing a set of special issues on another topic,the editors of the journal are interested in shifting the focus of thejournal, the topic of the paper is slightly away from the main interests ofthe editorial board, the paper is good, but just gets edged out by a set ofbetter papers that come in.

        Below follows a long comment that I posted to an article on O'Reilly Radar about patents.
The original blog post is here
There is an interesting compliment to the patent system in the domain of assigning credit to ideas, which is the academic peer-review system.
The inventor of the idea in the case of academia is the author. The equivalent to the patent office is the editorial board of the academic journal that the author submits to.

         I'm a Sci-Foo lurker, as I didn't make the cut to go this year, but I'vebeen lapping up the news seeping out of the meeting. So far my favoriteTwitter post about the meeting comes from Richard Ackerman's feed:
&quot;Timo and Tim are trying to kill us. Doesn't cult brainwashing start withsleep deprivation? Fun so far, anyway&quot;

         Yesterday one of the guy's at the office interviewed the producer of TheSimpsons. As a result he had to do quite a lot of research yesterday onSimsonalia, and decided to use the make your own simpson avatar tool on theSimpsons movie page to make all of us our own simpson character, this iswhat I would look like if I were a simpson.

        I've written up the short answers to some questions that you might have if this is the first time to use a mac, read through this and if you followthe suggestions you should have the hang to the system pretty quickly. If it turns out you don't like it, then at least you will have made an informeddecision!
-- Where is the right mouse button?
This is the biggest obvious first difference.

        I work at a pretty innovative place and the discussions that we have atlunch time are pretty mind bending. The last time I can recall having somany interesting discussions over lunch and breaks was way back when I wasin my first undergraduate degree, but the topics of conversation that tendto come up at my current place of employment are really worth trying torecord.
Today we started off having a couple of split conversation, Euan describingchatting to Martha at Sci-Foo and Euan and I talking about Euler, as you do.

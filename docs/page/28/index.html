        Back in January I set myself some goals for my climbing in 2008. The results at the end of the year were mixed, which means that I succeeded with some of my goals and patently failed with others. The was:
* Onsight Grit E2
* Redpoint f6c+
* 10 weekende+ trips in UK
* 5 red problems in a day in font
* 80 kg weight
* build climbing wall

        Last night I finally finished Neil Stephenson's Quicksilver. Oh, don't
get me wrong, I've read it, and the full trilogy, before, but for much
of the past year I have been re-reading it aloud to my girlfriend. She
has an eye strain which means that if she reads too much at night she
gets headaches, and so I've been doing the recreational reading for
the two of us over the past year.

        I'm at the netsci08 conference and there is a really delightful talk
about the network of papers published in the creationisim/evolution
debate.
The group looked at key people in the ID debate and people who acted as
strong defenders of evolution. One can then make a graph of the links
between the groups and intra-groups based on citation and co-citation.
Now one area of social science that is pretty interesting in this debate

        I've been interested for a while now in entity disambiguation,
particularly where the e
ntities are the names of authors in academic journals.
Jian Huang, Seyda Ertekin and C Lee Giles have a paper from 2006 in
which they describe
the method that they used to diambiguate the CiteSeer data set of
over 700,000 article
s. The paper is &quot;Efficient Name Disambiguation for Large-Scale Databases&quot;.
They were able to use this algorithim to disambiguate this data set

        I am, one might say, a bit of an RSS junkie. It has been the main source of
news and information for me for about the last year or so, but I began to
feel as if I was drowning in it. I subscribe to something over 80 feeds,
some of which, like techcrunch, spit out over 40 or 50 items a day. A few
days away from my feed reader and there could be well over 1000 entries

        I've just signed up for an account with twidox, which is a start up
that is collecting shared documents of interest to scientists, I
believe. They are in the private beta stage, but had a link on their
homepage for requesting an account. I got the following message when I
hit the verification link:

Registration is taking place!
Many thanks for you interest in twidox. Your account has been activated.

I just discovered this after poking around for an inordinate amount of time.
The trick is to use Time::HiRes instead.
Now someone should write a bridge function that overloads the Time::HR
functions with Time::HiRes functions which would make a code change as easy
as loading the overload module.

        Mark Newman, Networks in Space,
This is about networks in geographic space.
Mark is looking at properties of networks that are tied to geography.
Transport networks are a good example, and we are looking at the
difference between road and air networks.
The road and air networks are very different, even though you use both
of them for getting from A to B.
There is different bahviour, could I say 'driving' the use of these

        I was in, of all places, Godalming, at the weekend and ended up
browsing in a book store for a few moments. I saw what looked like a
very interesting book, href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/0007256523/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211186399&amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Predictably
Irrational. The book looks at the processes behind bad or
irrational decisions. The author is an economist and it seems the aim
of the book is to help us to see the emotional effects that influence

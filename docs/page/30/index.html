So, after a little more investigation it is clear that earlier links are
broken and new links have the snap preview.
Well, I guess I am just going to have to write links as plain text until
they get this thing sorted out.

        Having just gotten engaged and begun to look at the relative costs
involved in organising a wedding I woke up this morning with the
unavoidable realisation that the need to save for the wedding is going
to make purchasing an iPhone, while I have a perfectly normal
n95 that works rather well (especially since the broken key unstuck
and started working again) untenable. My cunning plan had been

In response to a query that popped up on Friend Feed:
I taught myself years ago with O'Reilly's Learning Python. The web
book 'Dive into Python' is essential, and the blog posts on
respectively 'How to Code like a Pythonista' and 'How to think like a
Pythonista' will get you a long way towards familiarizing yourself
with common idoms in the language.

        Well, a prediction about a new market that will spring up (perhaps it
already has) around the iPhone. So it costs $99 dollars to get an app that
you have built onto the phone through the App Store. If I design a vanity
app I'm not going to want to pay that much, but I might pay 5, 10 or even 15
dollars to see the child of my creativity bouncing around on the little

We are just unpacking some more furniture and we have discovered that the
spacers inside the boxes were made up of cut up pieces of IKEA furniture,
probably items that had been returned. It reminded my of the cells ability
to recycle old components.

        So after reading about some economists who decided to use economic theory to
loose weight I have decided to follow suit. They both decided to loose a
certain amount of weight by a certain time and places $5000 in a bond.
Whoever didn't make the weight lost their portion of the money to the other
person. The idea was to affect behavior through an incentive that
was significant. Well, I'm not a well paid economist, but I have decided to

I've been trying the free account this week. I've backed up 1.6 GB of data.
It took, with given interruptions of a normal work day, about 4 days to
backup this amount of Data.
I am beginning to think that the world of offline remote backups is still a
little bit away!

        I'm in Norwich all this week attending Netsci08
http://www.ifr.ac.uk/netsci08/, the internatinal workshop and conference
on network science. It's a week long event, and broadly speaking it
looks like there are three types themes that are being discussed here:
biological networks, pure networks science and community detection in
networks, principlaly emergent networks of the kind we see in the
internet.
I'm twittering about the meeting using the tag #netsci08, but it seems

        Nicholas Christakis, Harvard, &quot;eat drink and be merry, the spread of
health phenomena in social networks&quot;.
This talk is looking at the spread of desies throgh social interactions,
rather than other types of interactins. The main study was looking at
obesity using the Framingham Heart Study Social Network. This seems like
a very famouse social network health related study, so I'm not going to
go into detail about that, but the bottom line is that they were able to

        I'm really torn by the number of great talks on today. There are three
parallel sessions, and for each time slot I want to be in at least two
places at once. I'm going to try to pick out talks that have some
relation to online social networks, community detection and scientific
networks, but some of the talks on the theory of clustering are
conflicting directly with some use cases of looking at some online

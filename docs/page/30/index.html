        Matt talking about semanitic web for science, an introductionXML, URI, namespaces, RDL OWL,standards are often argued about but it;s just XML
we are supposed to be able to publish semantis data easily,at the moment it's not just an extension but a whole other world,people won't learn sapqrl
Matt believes that we can get the benifits of semantic now, but withoutin any case, it's hard to get funding
should consider semantic web, rather than Semantic Web,

         I've been trying the free account this week. I've backed up 1.6 GB of data.It took, with given interruptions of a normal work day, about 4 days tobackup this amount of Data.
I am beginning to think that the world of offline remote backups is still alittle bit away!

        I just posted the below as a comment on a blog, but it was good so I thoughtI'd repost here
What is open science and what is the system? Well I am sure that there aremany viewpoints on this, so I am going to just put forward one here.
At a fundamental level 'the system' is how we ascribe credit toparticipation in science. The credit is converted to grant money, thedollars keep the food on the plate.

         Thistech blog article is a charming description of how human behaviour seemsto have spread the name of a particular wireless node across america. Ithink it is a lovely example of the spread of an idea driven by simpleself-interest.

         I visited my girlfriend in Germany this weekend, and her father wascelebrating his 60th birthday. A friend of his arranged a full wild boarfrom the German forests. The spit it and slow cooked it for 7 hours, ittasted amazing. I can quite see why Asterix and friends got so excited aboutthis.

        &ldquo;Volvox&rdquo;:img:img:http://www.mulvany.net/photo/blogPics/volvox
The very first thing to die on it&rsquo;s own, without the intervention of an outside agent, was an organism called Volvox. The first life that we know of whose cells perish from old age, rather than misfortune. Before humble Volvox all other living things would go on forever, the immortal bacteria, the barely describable virus. Volvox introduced death by natural causes to the world, and all living things that came after that were as complex, or more so, followed suit, and found programmed within them some pace maker, set to expire after they had done their duty on the earth.

        Economics and The New World Order,
I had a rather detailed and engaging conversation on Friday night with a couple of good friends of mine about Economics, and it's explanatory power. My friend Brain holds that economics explains everything, except perhaps for the laws of physics. Now I am also tempted to buy into his arguments, he is quite a persuasive fellow, however I intrinsically feel some caution in doing so, and I have been trying to figure out why.

        I'm at the netsci08 conference and there is a really delightful talk
about the network of papers published in the creationisim/evolution
debate.
The group looked at key people in the ID debate and people who acted as
strong defenders of evolution. One can then make a graph of the links
between the groups and intra-groups based on citation and co-citation.
Now one area of social science that is pretty interesting in this debate

        This
article in Guardian today is describing a method of restoring colour to
some original BBC tv shows whose master tapes were wiped in a purge of the
BBC archives.
The shows were originally made in colour, then the master tapes were
destroyed to make more room in the BBC archive, however black and white
copies were made for distribution to countries which didn't have colour TV
capability. The black and white versions were on a smaller format (16 mm)

        I've been thinking about the streamosphere (as coined by Euan Adie),
and how I am starting to get dragged down in it again. I'm getting
daily notifications from pounce, twitter, friendfeed, linked in (I've
been ignoring facebook for ages, facebook, you bite my ass). What I
really need is a way to manage my notifications and communications in
the way that I now manage my rss feeds, through a bespoke piece of

        I've been interested for a while now in entity disambiguation,
particularly where the e
ntities are the names of authors in academic journals.
Jian Huang, Seyda Ertekin and C Lee Giles have a paper from 2006 in
which they describe
the method that they used to diambiguate the CiteSeer data set of
over 700,000 article
s. The paper is &quot;Efficient Name Disambiguation for Large-Scale Databases&quot;.
They were able to use this algorithim to disambiguate this data set

So, after a little more investigation it is clear that earlier links are
broken and new links have the snap preview.
Well, I guess I am just going to have to write links as plain text until
they get this thing sorted out.

        Having just gotten engaged and begun to look at the relative costs
involved in organising a wedding I woke up this morning with the
unavoidable realisation that the need to save for the wedding is going
to make purchasing an iPhone, while I have a perfectly normal
n95 that works rather well (especially since the broken key unstuck
and started working again) untenable. My cunning plan had been

        I am, one might say, a bit of an RSS junkie. It has been the main source of
news and information for me for about the last year or so, but I began to
feel as if I was drowning in it. I subscribe to something over 80 feeds,
some of which, like techcrunch, spit out over 40 or 50 items a day. A few
days away from my feed reader and there could be well over 1000 entries

In response to a query that popped up on Friend Feed:
I taught myself years ago with O'Reilly's Learning Python. The web
book 'Dive into Python' is essential, and the blog posts on
respectively 'How to Code like a Pythonista' and 'How to think like a
Pythonista' will get you a long way towards familiarizing yourself
with common idoms in the language.

        I've just signed up for an account with twidox, which is a start up
that is collecting shared documents of interest to scientists, I
believe. They are in the private beta stage, but had a link on their
homepage for requesting an account. I got the following message when I
hit the verification link:

We are just unpacking some more furniture and we have discovered that the
spacers inside the boxes were made up of cut up pieces of IKEA furniture,
probably items that had been returned. It reminded my of the cells ability
to recycle old components.

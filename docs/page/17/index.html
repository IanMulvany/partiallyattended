Originally uploaded by Ian MulvanyI just got some great feedback on this picture from someone on flickr, it was taken back in February when I was on a skiing holiday in Switzerland. The house was built by my wife's grandfather, and we came to it, it buried in a drift, the air as sharp as the icicles. It was a magical week, and I'm keen to return. At this time of the year thoughts turn to such things.

        Last night I had a strange anxiety dream. I&#39;m not usually prone to
blogging this kind of thing, but it was pretty odd. I dreamt that I
had been given command line access to a particle accelerator that was
embedded in that antarctic ice sheet. I&#39;d run some kind of a job and
forgotten about it. Two weeks later I got a bill for &#163;216, 000. I&#39;m
not sure if that was the bill for the data that was generated, or for

On Monday I was at the London Google wave roadshow presented by Lars and Stephanie. The previous Friday I had helped to run a hack day for science applications in wave, so with that experience fresh in my mind I was particularly interested to see what they would say about a few particular topics.
We had a few problems in the hack day which could be summarised as follows:

        I do a bit of code hacking and I often find myself putting objects into pickle files, and reading and writing them in order to fake object persistence. It's easy, but messy and it begins to leave lot's of pickle files sitting around in your path. I've decided to finally make the switch towards using a more grown up persistent object solution. I've decided to try out Django + SQLite.

        Last week an interesting invitation popped up in my email box, I got a
message from Richard Sterling asking if I would be interested in
previewing the program that the government are rolling out as part of
their open data project. They have set up a google group for
developers, and I guess I&#39;m on the waiting list, or something. I&#39;m
going to be interested to see what data sources surrounding science,

        Documentation on getting a google wave robot written in python working with the Cron functionality is still a little sparse. Getting a cron job into the capabilities.xml file. Add the following directive to the main function of your python program:
myRobot.RegisterCronJob('/path',60)
When you look at you capabilities.xml file you should now see a new node in the file:

        I had a brief discussion with a good friend and colleague this evening about the Drake equation. He has recently come to think that the equation can provide a good handle on understanding how many communicating civilizations exist in the universe, and how that reflects on the fragility of life on earth. A long time ago I had dismissed the Drake equation, feeling that it had very little to tell us about these matters.

        I&#39;m sitting at home in London with a head cold. For the dew minutes it took me to check my temperature (37 thank you very much) I was wondering whether it might be the old swine flu, but no, just a normal head cold.Made me think, someone should make a t-shirt with a biometric sensor that checks on true wearers&#39; temperature. No fever and it would say &quot;don&#39;t worry it&#39;s only a cold&quot;.

        The Navier-Stokes equations:
\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + ( \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla ) \mathbf{v} = -\nabla p + \nu\Delta \mathbf{v} +\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{x},t)

\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + ( \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla ) \mathbf{v} = -\nabla p + \nu\Delta \mathbf{v} +\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{x},t)

Describe the flow of an incompressible fluid. The equations are non-linear and are notoriously difficult to solve. I've always found them to be very beautiful and the fact that Sr George Stokes was an Irishman probably had some effect on my taking to the subject when I was an undergrad.

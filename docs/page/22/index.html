                    Ubigraph (http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/) Ubigraph (sorry for the
fucked up formatting, I think my blog host vox is still being shitty
at recognising simple html formatting in input, mixed with line
breaks, it's just a frickin url link for god's sake) is a nicely
implemented engine for making 3-D graphs and plots. I installed it and
got the default python interface up and running in about 5 minutes. My
initial reaction was &quot;this is cool&quot;.

mobile phone. I've been waiting for this to happen.

Remember DodgeBall, the early social mobile network that languished
after Google bought it? So does Leonard Lin, a founding member of
Upcoming.org who recently left Yahoo, where he organized Hack Days.

                    Nature, the company I work for, has been nominated for a Webby, woot!.
OK, so we are up against Nasa's earth observatory, and some other
great sites in the science field, but it's really nice to get a nod
and see that some other people out there like the kind of work that we
are doing. If you want to go and vote you can at this link herehttp://pv.webbyawards.com/ballot/home/1.

                    Yesterday the Guardian had a special pull out section dedicated to the
LHC. If you browse through the articles you find lots of comments along
the lines of
&quot;temple to mystery and imagination&quot;, &quot;a journey to the edge of
understanding&quot;. &quot;a modern cathedral to our relationship with the
universe&quot;, and so on. From the superlatives that are being written one
would think that the LHC is the best thing to happen to enlightenment

I just got the following Yay!
&quot;Hi,
Somebody has sent you a Brightkite invite. Brightkite is a
location-based social network, currently in private beta.
Personal message:
The wait is over! Here's your Brightkite beta invite. Enjoy!&quot;
Then on sign up discovered that it is only supported by a number of US
carriers, boo.

My colleague Gavin Bell just uploaded a great presentation about creating communities of readers out of readers of books. You can see his presentation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/gavin/gavin-bell-from-readers-of-books-to-a-community-of-readers-oreilly-toc08/&quot;&gt;here on slideshare&lt;/a&gt;. He gave this talk at the Tools Of Change conference in New York earlier this month.

                    One of my friends is writing a series of blogs about Darwin.
It looks like a very nice series of blog posts, and I look forward to the
rest.

You can read it here.

Of course as a physicist I disagree with one comment in this first post:

&quot;From an intellectual point of view, the Origin is the most significant work
of the millennium, and the most important work of non-fiction ever.

                    I had a great idea yesterday while I was engaged on a personal odyssey on
London buses. I was on the top deck of, I think it was the 176, heading down
past Old Street into the square mile, round St Paul's (with a quick glimpse
of millennium bridge, and then on into the strand. The bus went past so many
statues, churches and historical buildings, but I knew only a few of them.

Last night I got my first UK 6a boulder problem at the Castle climbing wall,
it's been a while since I was making progress with my climbing, so that was
great.My climbing diary is here: http://jottit.com/h94hx/

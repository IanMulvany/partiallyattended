        The following paper &quot;Soft peer review: Social software and distributed
scientific evaluation&quot; was passed along to me by alf today. I think
another copy has been haunting my file system for a few days, but this
seemed like a good reason to sit down again with it.
It's by Dario
Taraborelli and the abstract is as follows:

        So, I've been having some problems with the Vox service for some time,
and now I have a twine invitation, so I am going to test out Twine as
a platform for blogging.
The way I blog is that I tend to write up my blog posts in a mail
client and then mail these to the blog engine, but so far Vox as a
service has been soso.

        I'm reading a great article by Joe Esposito on Open Access. You can read
the article
here:http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;cc=jep;rgn=main;view=text;idno=3336451.0011.203.
The article's main claim is that attention is the barrier to
disemination rather than access. Another claim of this article is that
paid for publishing platforms are good for readers in that they act as
an attention filter.
One of the main claims of the article is that Open Content in a sea of

        Ubigraph (http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/) Ubigraph (sorry for the
fucked up formatting, I think my blog host vox is still being shitty
at recognising simple html formatting in input, mixed with line
breaks, it's just a frickin url link for god's sake) is a nicely
implemented engine for making 3-D graphs and plots. I installed it and
got the default python interface up and running in about 5 minutes. My
initial reaction was &quot;this is cool&quot;.

mobile phone. I've been waiting for this to happen.

Remember DodgeBall, the early social mobile network that languished
after Google bought it? So does Leonard Lin, a founding member of
Upcoming.org who recently left Yahoo, where he organized Hack Days.

        Nature, the company I work for, has been nominated for a Webby, woot!.
OK, so we are up against Nasa's earth observatory, and some other
great sites in the science field, but it's really nice to get a nod
and see that some other people out there like the kind of work that we
are doing. If you want to go and vote you can at this link herehttp://pv.webbyawards.com/ballot/home/1.

        Yesterday the Guardian had a special pull out section dedicated to the
LHC. If you browse through the articles you find lots of comments along
the lines of
&quot;temple to mystery and imagination&quot;, &quot;a journey to the edge of
understanding&quot;. &quot;a modern cathedral to our relationship with the
universe&quot;, and so on. From the superlatives that are being written one
would think that the LHC is the best thing to happen to enlightenment

I just got the following Yay!
&quot;Hi,
Somebody has sent you a Brightkite invite. Brightkite is a
location-based social network, currently in private beta.
Personal message:
The wait is over! Here's your Brightkite beta invite. Enjoy!&quot;
Then on sign up discovered that it is only supported by a number of US
carriers, boo.

My colleague Gavin Bell just uploaded a great presentation about creating communities of readers out of readers of books. You can see his presentation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/gavin/gavin-bell-from-readers-of-books-to-a-community-of-readers-oreilly-toc08/&quot;&gt;here on slideshare&lt;/a&gt;. He gave this talk at the Tools Of Change conference in New York earlier this month.

        One of my friends is writing a series of blogs about Darwin.
It looks like a very nice series of blog posts, and I look forward to the
rest.

You can read it here.

Of course as a physicist I disagree with one comment in this first post:

&quot;From an intellectual point of view, the Origin is the most significant work
of the millennium, and the most important work of non-fiction ever.

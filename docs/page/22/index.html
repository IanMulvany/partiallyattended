        Probabilistic language models, auto-correction tools and scientific discovery.
"Durgesh Kumar Dwivedi":http://network.nature.com/people/U56CB3E51/profile over on Nature Network just asked "Does anyone have any software or web address which corrects English grammar, preposition, edit and shortened the paragraphs?". This question brought to mind and idea that I had a few years ago.
The idea is simple enough, use a large corpus of pre-vetted grammatically correct text as a training tool to compare sentences against.

        You have a couple of options for setting the height of your gadget. I'll run through four methods that seem to work. First two words of caution, if you are using the eclipse plugin to develop on, you won't see the second method described here working. I don't know why, but the code works in iGoogle, so it must be something to do with the eclipse OSDE env. The second word of warning is that the syntax hilighter I'm using on this post chokes on CDATA tags, so the CDATA tags in the code examples are wrong.

        Via Bruce Schneir&#39;s blog there is a link to a paper about a new
security system that credit card companies are rolling out; a single
sign on system. The paper is here:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/fc10vbvsecurecode.pdf. The
bottom line is that the system is pretty insecure, but it is
incentivised by making the customer sign up to additional terms and
conditions that puts more liability on them than on the banks or

        Nature has just published an editorial (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7281/full/463588a.html) promoting the idea of writing text books (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/463588a).
Having worked for a number of years as a commissioning editor for a
major academic publisher, responsible for more that 20% of academic
book output, I have to say that the cost-benifit analysis for
publishing books ends up saying that it just does not justify the
effort for academics to write monographs. You probably won't see more

        I just posted the following on a forum
(http://network.nature.com/groups/orcid/forum/topics/6547) on Nature
Network, I thought it was interesting enough to repost:Bruce Schneier yesterday posted a very &quot;interesting
article&quot;:http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/anonymity_and_t_3.html
that gets to the heart of identity systems on the web. The bottom line
of the article is that anonymity will always be a given as the price
for introducing verification or coining systems will always be too
high, and even if present they won&#39;t be effective.

        Having a discussion earlier today with one of my colleagues, we were
discussing pricing models for iPhone applications. I buy a lot of apps
on my iPhone, but the content that we were discussing pricing for is
academic article content. This traditionally sells online for tens of
dollars per unit. If one wants to sell such content on an iPhone, but
at the same time retain the apparent value of the content how do you

        I&#39;m eating a chocolate bar which contains, I&#39;m told, a &#39;cheeky caramel
layer&#39;. It&#39;s shit like this that makes me despair of our modern
civilisation. According to the dictionary &#39;cheeky&#39; means &#39;impudent;
insolent&#39;, and it has the synonyms &#39;saucy, audacious, bold&#39;. I guess
that I am to feel that I have made a bold choice in opting for the
opulence provided by that extra caramel, but I can&#39;t raise the

        I just commented over on the digatilist:I&#39;m in two minds, but on balance I&#39;m optimistic. What they are
delivering is not a product, but a new platform, and one who&#39;s
limitation has the potential to drive innovation in the open web. What
I really don&#39;t like about what has been delivered is how closed the
system is, and how much this is not a tool that a developer could use.

        &ldquo;Volvox&rdquo;:img:img:http://www.mulvany.net/photo/blogPics/volvox
The very first thing to die on it&rsquo;s own, without the intervention of an outside agent, was an organism called Volvox. The first life that we know of whose cells perish from old age, rather than misfortune. Before humble Volvox all other living things would go on forever, the immortal bacteria, the barely describable virus. Volvox introduced death by natural causes to the world, and all living things that came after that were as complex, or more so, followed suit, and found programmed within them some pace maker, set to expire after they had done their duty on the earth.

        Economics and The New World Order,
I had a rather detailed and engaging conversation on Friday night with a couple of good friends of mine about Economics, and it's explanatory power. My friend Brain holds that economics explains everything, except perhaps for the laws of physics. Now I am also tempted to buy into his arguments, he is quite a persuasive fellow, however I intrinsically feel some caution in doing so, and I have been trying to figure out why.

        I wrote a large post at the start of this year reviewing my climbing goals over previous years, and laying out my goals for 2014. A key modification for me in 2014 is changing to a strategy where I set goals quarterly, rather than yearly. Let&rsquo;s review Q1.
Goals for q1 2014  try at least 12 routes of 6c or harder
I managed to try exactly 12 routes of 6c in the last 12 weeks, and my last try yielded success.

        Discussing Open Access http://discussingoa.wordpress.com/
I read through this piece by Rick Anderson. It&rsquo;s a very good piece. It does an excellent job of articulating some of the challenges of subscription publishing and of various forms of open access publishing.
I have a couple of relativly minor issues with it.
The impression I got from reading it was that OA advocates are more shouty and incapable of a serious debate on the issue than advocates of a subscription model, and possibly those who pursue subscription models are more open minded.

        Yesterday I attended an interesting meeting to discuss how to improve the connection between clinical trial registration ids and publications. My raw notes from the meeting follow. This is being discussed as publication threads, but the idea discussed here stands apart from the kind of publication threads that the endcode project worked on.

        For the last couple of years I have done an end of year review of my climbing over the previous year, and set myself some goals for the coming year. Rather than doing exactly the same thing this time, I thought it would be good to look back at several of these reviews over the past couple of years, look at the data on my climbing, and see if I could discover any insights.

        Last Thursday I attended the launch event for OverLeaf. The event was composed of a set of very short talks, followed by a good chance to chat to people. It was a pretty nice evening.

        I have posted this post as a comment on the thread over at software carpentry in answer to the question What do we teach about writing/publishing papers in a webby world?
I ended up writing a bit more than I expected, so here are the main peices of advice:
tl;dr:
- use a reference management tool
- try to find the fastest venue to publish in
- try to publish in an OA journal

        Today I&rsquo;m at the STM innovations seminar. The twitter tag for today is #ukinno. The program is online.
I&rsquo;m going to take a light approach to blogging today, I&rsquo;ll probably hang out mostly on Twitter.

        Just attended the STM brainstroming session. I&rsquo;ll update these notes in due course, and fix spelling issues, but I wanted to get the post live first.
Notes I&rsquo;ll just mention the things that I found interesting. ## Round1
Science Gists get a mention, yay!!
Google scholar library gets a mention.
Visualising data as maps is mentioned, mentions that there are no standards
Howard mentions much richer tagging in the article, and upfront semantic tagging.

        I was bouldering yesterday. At my local block - a lump of granite embedded in the middle of shore ditch park. I&rsquo;ve been climbing on this block pretty much since the week it was put in place.
Yesterday I saw that a hold I&rsquo;d never noticed had been chalked up. It&rsquo;s a great hold, at about shoulder height. It fits that pads of two and a half fingers, and in spite of being quite small, it feels pretty positive.

        I have a new macbook pro. I want to install vagrant, chef and librarian, with the vagrant-aws plugins. I&rsquo;m working on OSX Mavericks, and I want to get as clean an install as possible. For the most part I am also using the fish shell. This is what I&rsquo;ve just run through over the last 20 minutes.
 Install command line tools from the terminal
$ xcode-select --install  Next we are going to install homebrew, with homebrew we will install rvm and with rvm we will install ruby.

        O'Reilly are hosting a Collaborative Intelligence foo camp this coming
weekend. There is some discussion bubbling out already on crowdvine at a group that has been created for this
meeting.
One of the participants, Greg Linden, says the following:
&quot;Hi, Cass. Absolutely, this is called the pigeonhole problem and can be an
issue if personalization is done poorly.
Done right, personalization enhances discover by helping you find things you

        This
article in Guardian today is describing a method of restoring colour to
some original BBC tv shows whose master tapes were wiped in a purge of the
BBC archives.
The shows were originally made in colour, then the master tapes were
destroyed to make more room in the BBC archive, however black and white
copies were made for distribution to countries which didn't have colour TV
capability. The black and white versions were on a smaller format (16 mm)

        I've been thinking about the streamosphere (as coined by Euan Adie),
and how I am starting to get dragged down in it again. I'm getting
daily notifications from pounce, twitter, friendfeed, linked in (I've
been ignoring facebook for ages, facebook, you bite my ass). What I
really need is a way to manage my notifications and communications in
the way that I now manage my rss feeds, through a bespoke piece of

So, after a little more investigation it is clear that earlier links are
broken and new links have the snap preview.
Well, I guess I am just going to have to write links as plain text until
they get this thing sorted out.

        Having just gotten engaged and begun to look at the relative costs
involved in organising a wedding I woke up this morning with the
unavoidable realisation that the need to save for the wedding is going
to make purchasing an iPhone, while I have a perfectly normal
n95 that works rather well (especially since the broken key unstuck
and started working again) untenable. My cunning plan had been
to wait until the end of my current contract, at which point the new

In response to a query that popped up on Friend Feed:
I taught myself years ago with O'Reilly's Learning Python. The web
book 'Dive into Python' is essential, and the blog posts on
respectively 'How to Code like a Pythonista' and 'How to think like a
Pythonista' will get you a long way towards familiarizing yourself
with common idoms in the language.

        Well, a prediction about a new market that will spring up (perhaps it
already has) around the iPhone. So it costs $99 dollars to get an app that
you have built onto the phone through the App Store. If I design a vanity
app I'm not going to want to pay that much, but I might pay 5, 10 or even 15
dollars to see the child of my creativity bouncing around on the little

We are just unpacking some more furniture and we have discovered that the
spacers inside the boxes were made up of cut up pieces of IKEA furniture,
probably items that had been returned. It reminded my of the cells ability
to recycle old components.

        So after reading about some economists who decided to use economic theory to
loose weight I have decided to follow suit. They both decided to loose a
certain amount of weight by a certain time and places $5000 in a bond.
Whoever didn't make the weight lost their portion of the money to the other
person. The idea was to affect behavior through an incentive that
was significant. Well, I'm not a well paid economist, but I have decided to

I've been trying the free account this week. I've backed up 1.6 GB of data.
It took, with given interruptions of a normal work day, about 4 days to
backup this amount of Data.
I am beginning to think that the world of offline remote backups is still a
little bit away!

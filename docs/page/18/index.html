                    Well, today I finally made a switch that I had been thinking about for a long time, I moved the hosting of my personal domain to google app engine with email being managed by google apps for my domain. http://www.mulvany.net is now a google app engine site. At the moment there is not much content there, but the google app engine tool allows me to run a perfect cop of my site off line, and to edit locally and then push live.

                    Right, well, I'm pretty interested in graph theory. I work in publishing for the journal Nature on new web products, and I need a focussed way of getting my thoughts together on a range of topics that touch on science. I wanted a space that was more focussed than my personal blog.
I have a few specific aims for this blog. Get some of my thoughts on publishing, science and the philosophy of science out of my head and into an archived public space

                    I've been thinking about neat ways to make blogs approach research articles; about how to make some of the core features of a journal be more apparent in a blog, which has led me to think about blogger widgets. That led me to the Phydeaux3 blog where there is a kick ass implementation of a widget to display a tag cloud for blogger. Hopefully you can see that it works pretty well.

                    Last month I bought some rail tickets online, and got to London Bridge only to be told that I had to go to Liverpool Street in order to print out the tickets. Five minutes before my train was due to depart. I had to buy a new set of tickets for that days journey, and get up extra early the next day to make it to Liverpool street to print out my tickets.

                    Five places to eat in New York,

Ikeep trying to think of great places to go in the city, so here is a shortlist of five of my favorite places to eat in New York. Not fancy, notexhaustive, just five places that I remember fondly now that I look back onmy time there.

                    Also Mona's bar on 13th and b (a bit of a dive, but all the better for it)
The east village/alphabet street areas have great bars, there used to be one called the drugstore.
Best Bagel: H&H on 75thish and broadway
Ah, sure, it's not a bad wee city.
Oh, the museums, they are pretty good too.
The Metropolitan (it's free)
The Frick Collection
- Guggenheim (depending what's on)

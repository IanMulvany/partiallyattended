        One of my friends is writing a series of blogs about Darwin.
It looks like a very nice series of blog posts, and I look forward to the
rest.

You can read it here.

Of course as a physicist I disagree with one comment in this first post:

&quot;From an intellectual point of view, the Origin is the most significant work
of the millennium, and the most important work of non-fiction ever.

        I had a great idea yesterday while I was engaged on a personal odyssey on
London buses. I was on the top deck of, I think it was the 176, heading down
past Old Street into the square mile, round St Paul's (with a quick glimpse
of millennium bridge, and then on into the strand. The bus went past so many
statues, churches and historical buildings, but I knew only a few of them.

I continued along the canal as usual and as I came past sainsbury's in
islington saw the same guy in the same car, as I passed him!
Bike 1, Masarati + London Traffic 0.

        O'Reilly are hosting a Collaborative Intelligence foo camp this coming
weekend. There is some discussion bubbling out already on crowdvine at a group that has been created for this
meeting.
One of the participants, Greg Linden, says the following:
&quot;Hi, Cass. Absolutely, this is called the pigeonhole problem and can be an
issue if personalization is done poorly.
Done right, personalization enhances discover by helping you find things you

        This
article in Guardian today is describing a method of restoring colour to
some original BBC tv shows whose master tapes were wiped in a purge of the
BBC archives.
The shows were originally made in colour, then the master tapes were
destroyed to make more room in the BBC archive, however black and white
copies were made for distribution to countries which didn't have colour TV
capability. The black and white versions were on a smaller format (16 mm)

        I've been thinking about the streamosphere (as coined by Euan Adie),
and how I am starting to get dragged down in it again. I'm getting
daily notifications from pounce, twitter, friendfeed, linked in (I've
been ignoring facebook for ages, facebook, you bite my ass). What I
really need is a way to manage my notifications and communications in
the way that I now manage my rss feeds, through a bespoke piece of

So, after a little more investigation it is clear that earlier links are
broken and new links have the snap preview.
Well, I guess I am just going to have to write links as plain text until
they get this thing sorted out.

        Having just gotten engaged and begun to look at the relative costs
involved in organising a wedding I woke up this morning with the
unavoidable realisation that the need to save for the wedding is going
to make purchasing an iPhone, while I have a perfectly normal
n95 that works rather well (especially since the broken key unstuck
and started working again) untenable. My cunning plan had been
to wait until the end of my current contract, at which point the new

In response to a query that popped up on Friend Feed:
I taught myself years ago with O'Reilly's Learning Python. The web
book 'Dive into Python' is essential, and the blog posts on
respectively 'How to Code like a Pythonista' and 'How to think like a
Pythonista' will get you a long way towards familiarizing yourself
with common idoms in the language.

        So the question of the day is if Hillary Clinton becomes
Vice-President, would she be more or less evil than Dick Cheney?
Now Dick Cheney is evil Inc. but the guy has never really pretended to
be anything that he isn't, whereas Hillary would obviously
lie and make policy in any way possible to win votes, which means that
though she might not be as intrinsically as evil as Dick Cheney, she

        I have been liking using vox to blog, mainly because I can email a blog post
from any email client. This significantly reduces the
effort involved in posting a blog post.
I've just discovered that vox has enabled snap previews. I don't like them.
OK, so, some people may like them, and that's OK, but I can't turn them off
on my blog. That's not good.
In addition, when I email a link the link is now broken in vox, so if I type

        Scribd has rolled out a very nice
interface to pdf documents. It is neat and slick, but I think what it is
missing is support for getting at data or meta-data in the document. It
would be a great boon to be able to click on a table in a document and have
that tabular data open either in excel or in some online document tool.
Likewise for entities in the document that might have associated metadata.

        There is a tension between the providers of social software, and the
way we behave. When I move from one city to another my social network
changes as that's very location dependent, but when I do have that
network set up for the most part, I don't expect restrictions on where
I can go in that city with my friends. For sure, some friends of mine
might not be caught dead in the palace bar, they only drink in the

&quot;The modified tactical standard missile 3 (SM-3) hit the satellite at an
altitude of 150 miles (247km) while it was travelling at approximately
17,000 miles per hour.&quot;
I find this somewhat scary.

This is funny, and a little bit scary too.

        Well, I just read through the engadget report on the iPhone SDK and it's
looking pretty good. I'm in the middle of downloading the free SDK, mainly
so that I can have a virtual iPhone to play around with, but last night I
got to thinking about what kind of applications I personally would like to
see on the device.
I live in London, but I frequently travel to Europe.

        A few weeks ago I was a beer festival in Munich, and I was talking tosomeone who was working on something, hey it was a beer festival, but then Ihad an idea about the type of interface that might be really useful fordoing search. We now search for images using text, so somewhere someone hasto build the text to image representation of the images in their database.Arguably this is one area where tagging has made an enormous improvement,ala flickr, but it seems to me that if you could make an interface thatwould allow a user to either draw or assemble a rough draft of the imagethey were searching for then this might offer a powerful and complimentaryapproach.

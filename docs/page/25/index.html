        Last month I bought some rail tickets online, and got to London Bridge only to be told that I had to go to Liverpool Street in order to print out the tickets. Five minutes before my train was due to depart. I had to buy a new set of tickets for that days journey, and get up extra early the next day to make it to Liverpool street to print out my tickets.

Ikeep trying to think of great places to go in the city, so here is a shortlist of five of my favorite places to eat in New York. Not fancy, notexhaustive, just five places that I remember fondly now that I look back onmy time there.

        Also Mona's bar on 13th and b (a bit of a dive, but all the better for it)
The east village/alphabet street areas have great bars, there used to be one called the drugstore.
Best Bagel: H&H on 75thish and broadway
Ah, sure, it's not a bad wee city.
Oh, the museums, they are pretty good too.
The Metropolitan (it's free)
The Frick Collection

        OK, so, I've fallen off the wagon in terms of climbing training, or in fact training of any kind.
Last weekend was interesting. I did the introductory PADI course, but the week leading up to the weekend was swamped with work, and all of the nights of this week have filled up too. I think in order to get my running done I am going to have to transition to a morning run a few times a week.

        I am working on a project where I have to pass some data from tables in a MySQL DB over to some people who don't use a relational database. The question is, how I can best extract the data in a way that is useable to them?
I've decided to prepare the data for them as XML, as this prevents problems with
My approach uses a hacked together collection of scripts, because, well, as Mark Pilgrim says, because fuck you.

Bouldering at the castleOK, I&#39;m a bit late posting this training update. Last week was the
snowy week in London, and I was lazy, boo me, however after not
climbing for two weeks and given the very poor training week I was
uncertain how things would go, which is to say I thought I would not
be very good, however my expectations were unfounded and I had a

        You will need to install XML support as a ScriptingAddition for script editor. You can get this from http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/XMLTools2/. Quit and restart script editor after you have installed the extension. I found that when I was trying to compile the code script editor gave me a syntax error before I installed the extension. The syntax error dissapeard after I installed the extension, but the extensions themselves didn't work until I restarted script editor.

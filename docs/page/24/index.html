        Having a discussion earlier today with one of my colleagues, we were
discussing pricing models for iPhone applications. I buy a lot of apps
on my iPhone, but the content that we were discussing pricing for is
academic article content. This traditionally sells online for tens of
dollars per unit. If one wants to sell such content on an iPhone, but
at the same time retain the apparent value of the content how do you

        I&#39;m eating a chocolate bar which contains, I&#39;m told, a &#39;cheeky caramel
layer&#39;. It&#39;s shit like this that makes me despair of our modern
civilisation. According to the dictionary &#39;cheeky&#39; means &#39;impudent;
insolent&#39;, and it has the synonyms &#39;saucy, audacious, bold&#39;. I guess
that I am to feel that I have made a bold choice in opting for the

        I just commented over on the digatilist:I&#39;m in two minds, but on balance I&#39;m optimistic. What they are
delivering is not a product, but a new platform, and one who&#39;s
limitation has the potential to drive innovation in the open web. What
I really don&#39;t like about what has been delivered is how closed the
system is, and how much this is not a tool that a developer could use.

        Looking back at my goals for 2009, I've not done very well, however my current level of fitness is pretty good, so I think 2010 is going to be a good year.
The main factors in holding back my climbing in 2009 were taking a few months off to get married and not being able to rent a car. Getting married was absolutely worth it, and the level of organisation and stability I have in my life now due to being married will only help in the long run.

Originally uploaded by Ian MulvanyI just got some great feedback on this picture from someone on flickr, it was taken back in February when I was on a skiing holiday in Switzerland. The house was built by my wife's grandfather, and we came to it, it buried in a drift, the air as sharp as the icicles. It was a magical week, and I'm keen to return. At this time of the year thoughts turn to such things.

        I don&#39;t know if the following is going to work, but I&#39;m going to try
it. Dopplr allows you to subscribe to your trips in iCal from a link
from the trips page. You can also publish a calendar locally to the
Dopplr servers that Dopplr will pull trips from. I&#39;ve set up two
calendars in my iCal, one for pushing into Dopplr, and another for
pulling all Dopplr trips from.

        Last night I had a strange anxiety dream. I&#39;m not usually prone to
blogging this kind of thing, but it was pretty odd. I dreamt that I
had been given command line access to a particle accelerator that was
embedded in that antarctic ice sheet. I&#39;d run some kind of a job and
forgotten about it. Two weeks later I got a bill for &#163;216, 000. I&#39;m
not sure if that was the bill for the data that was generated, or for

On Monday I was at the London Google wave roadshow presented by Lars and Stephanie. The previous Friday I had helped to run a hack day for science applications in wave, so with that experience fresh in my mind I was particularly interested to see what they would say about a few particular topics.
We had a few problems in the hack day which could be summarised as follows:

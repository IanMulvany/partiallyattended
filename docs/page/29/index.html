        Back in January I set myself some goals for my climbing in 2008. The results at the end of the year were mixed, which means that I succeeded with some of my goals and patently failed with others. The was:
* Onsight Grit E2
* Redpoint f6c+
* 10 weekende+ trips in UK
* 5 red problems in a day in font
* 80 kg weight
* build climbing wall

My colleague Gavin Bell just uploaded a great presentation about creating communities of readers out of readers of books. You can see his presentation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/gavin/gavin-bell-from-readers-of-books-to-a-community-of-readers-oreilly-toc08/&quot;&gt;here on slideshare&lt;/a&gt;. He gave this talk at the Tools Of Change conference in New York earlier this month.

        Last night I finally finished Neil Stephenson's Quicksilver. Oh, don't
get me wrong, I've read it, and the full trilogy, before, but for much
of the past year I have been re-reading it aloud to my girlfriend. She
has an eye strain which means that if she reads too much at night she
gets headaches, and so I've been doing the recreational reading for
the two of us over the past year.

        One of my friends is writing a series of blogs about Darwin.
It looks like a very nice series of blog posts, and I look forward to the
rest.

You can read it here.

Of course as a physicist I disagree with one comment in this first post:

&quot;From an intellectual point of view, the Origin is the most significant work
of the millennium, and the most important work of non-fiction ever.

        I had a great idea yesterday while I was engaged on a personal odyssey on
London buses. I was on the top deck of, I think it was the 176, heading down
past Old Street into the square mile, round St Paul's (with a quick glimpse
of millennium bridge, and then on into the strand. The bus went past so many
statues, churches and historical buildings, but I knew only a few of them.

        O'Reilly are hosting a Collaborative Intelligence foo camp this coming
weekend. There is some discussion bubbling out already on crowdvine at a group that has been created for this
meeting.
One of the participants, Greg Linden, says the following:
&quot;Hi, Cass. Absolutely, this is called the pigeonhole problem and can be an
issue if personalization is done poorly.
Done right, personalization enhances discover by helping you find things you

        I'm at the netsci08 conference and there is a really delightful talk
about the network of papers published in the creationisim/evolution
debate.
The group looked at key people in the ID debate and people who acted as
strong defenders of evolution. One can then make a graph of the links
between the groups and intra-groups based on citation and co-citation.
Now one area of social science that is pretty interesting in this debate

        OK, so, I've fallen off the wagon in terms of climbing training, or in fact training of any kind.
Last weekend was interesting. I did the introductory PADI course, but the week leading up to the weekend was swamped with work, and all of the nights of this week have filled up too. I think in order to get my running done I am going to have to transition to a morning run a few times a week.

        I am working on a project where I have to pass some data from tables in a MySQL DB over to some people who don't use a relational database. The question is, how I can best extract the data in a way that is useable to them?
I've decided to prepare the data for them as XML, as this prevents problems with
My approach uses a hacked together collection of scripts, because, well, as Mark Pilgrim says, because fuck you.

Bouldering at the castleOK, I&#39;m a bit late posting this training update. Last week was the
snowy week in London, and I was lazy, boo me, however after not
climbing for two weeks and given the very poor training week I was
uncertain how things would go, which is to say I thought I would not
be very good, however my expectations were unfounded and I had a

        You will need to install XML support as a ScriptingAddition for script editor. You can get this from http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/XMLTools2/. Quit and restart script editor after you have installed the extension. I found that when I was trying to compile the code script editor gave me a syntax error before I installed the extension. The syntax error dissapeard after I installed the extension, but the extensions themselves didn't work until I restarted script editor.

        A week snowboarding in Switzerland, 6 days total with a rest day on
the Wed. Pretty fantastic!I didn&#39;t get any running done, and looking at the current weather in
London, it is looking like I won&#39;t get any running done this week
either.My training summary for January 2009 then is as follows:Number of exercise sessions = 18
Number of days with exercise = 17 (54%)
Total distance = 49 km

        Well, a prediction about a new market that will spring up (perhaps it
already has) around the iPhone. So it costs $99 dollars to get an app that
you have built onto the phone through the App Store. If I design a vanity
app I'm not going to want to pay that much, but I might pay 5, 10 or even 15
dollars to see the child of my creativity bouncing around on the little

I just discovered this after poking around for an inordinate amount of time.
The trick is to use Time::HiRes instead.
Now someone should write a bridge function that overloads the Time::HR
functions with Time::HiRes functions which would make a code change as easy
as loading the overload module.

I've been trying the free account this week. I've backed up 1.6 GB of data.
It took, with given interruptions of a normal work day, about 4 days to
backup this amount of Data.
I am beginning to think that the world of offline remote backups is still a
little bit away!

        I'm in Norwich all this week attending Netsci08
http://www.ifr.ac.uk/netsci08/, the internatinal workshop and conference
on network science. It's a week long event, and broadly speaking it
looks like there are three types themes that are being discussed here:
biological networks, pure networks science and community detection in
networks, principlaly emergent networks of the kind we see in the
internet.
I'm twittering about the meeting using the tag #netsci08, but it seems

        Nicholas Christakis, Harvard, &quot;eat drink and be merry, the spread of
health phenomena in social networks&quot;.
This talk is looking at the spread of desies throgh social interactions,
rather than other types of interactins. The main study was looking at
obesity using the Framingham Heart Study Social Network. This seems like
a very famouse social network health related study, so I'm not going to
go into detail about that, but the bottom line is that they were able to

        I'm really torn by the number of great talks on today. There are three
parallel sessions, and for each time slot I want to be in at least two
places at once. I'm going to try to pick out talks that have some
relation to online social networks, community detection and scientific
networks, but some of the talks on the theory of clustering are
conflicting directly with some use cases of looking at some online

        Mark Newman, Networks in Space,
This is about networks in geographic space.
Mark is looking at properties of networks that are tied to geography.
Transport networks are a good example, and we are looking at the
difference between road and air networks.
The road and air networks are very different, even though you use both
of them for getting from A to B.
There is different bahviour, could I say 'driving' the use of these

        The second talk in the evening CREEN parallel session is from J. Holyst
about phase transitions in coupled complex networks where the network
properties are different in the two groups.
In one group there are a smaller number of members, but they are tightly
coupled. The second group is larger, but less tightly coupled. The model
uses an Ising model. The less coupled group has higher fluctuation in

that introducing the bonus points system to the Six Nations rugby tournament could help make it more entertaining (not that it needs much help in that regard, as it is a fantastic tournament as it is). I&#160;wholeheartedly&#160;agree. At the moment you get 2 points if you win a game, and 1 point if you draw. Under the bonus system you get an extra point if you score 4 tries and you get a bonus point if you are a losing team and you hold you opposition to a gap of 7 points or less.

        Ever since Ian Clarke mentioned the potential delights of python to me
whilst passing me in a corridor back in 1999 I've been tinkering around with
that language.
Christ, that's almost 10 years. I like python, it gave a great sense of
freedom after spending a heavy five years working with various flavours of
FORTRAN, from
FORTRAN 90, through to High Performance Fortran. Well, now here I am

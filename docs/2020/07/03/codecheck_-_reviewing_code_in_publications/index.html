<p>Checking software in research is a significant challenge, and I really like CODECHECK because it is an initiative that has emerged from researchers themselves.</p>
<p>I met Stephen at an event earlier this year (when we still did those) and he recently emailed me with an update on the service. Below are some of the recent highlights.</p>
<p>Of note are their contributions in checking the COVID models.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our first &ldquo;proper&rdquo; CODECHECK certificate was for a Gigascience paper
that came out in April. Scott Edmunds helped with a blog piece about
it:  <a href="https://github.com/codecheckers/Piccolo-2020">https://github.com/codecheckers/Piccolo-2020</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our biggest impact has been codechecking the (infamous) COVID model
from Neil Ferguson&rsquo;s group at Imperial College; Nature News ran a piece
on this recently:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01685-y">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01685-y</a>
By contrast to all the alarm in the media, I found the results
reproducible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m now finishing up a couple of other COVID models from Imperial
(having done some others for LSHTM). For one of the LSHTM papers,
because we worked on a preprint as it (unknown to me) was going through
peer review, the authors acknowledged and cited the certificate (ref 18)
in their Lancet Public Health
paper.  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246826672030133X">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246826672030133X</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the certificates completed so
far are browsable via:  <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/codecheck/">https://zenodo.org/communities/codecheck/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The certificates are evolving as we learn more about the process, so
I think it will be a while yet before we hit a stable idea of what a
certificate should look like. We&rsquo;ve probably also done a poor job of
collecting the relevant metadata and getting certificates deposited in
correct manner.</p>

</ol>

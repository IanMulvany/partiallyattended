          <p>In my department we have started to make a bit of space to allow for self learning to
happen. I took the time to look at <a href="https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">https://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</a>, an ecosystem of tools that support
data publishing. These tools are from Simon Willison, and they are fantastic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been meaning to look at the them for some time now. I used a jupyter notebook
to work my way around getting some data together, and working with the tool.</p>
<p>In the notebook I:</p>
<ul>
<li>get some data about 100 BMJ articles using the crossref API</li>
<li>take a selection of the metadata from those articles</li>
<li>install Datasette locally</li>
<li>use sqlite_utils to create a local sqlite database</li>
<li>use datasette running locally to explore and interact with this data</li>
<li>export to CSV from my local instance</li>
<li>upload this CSV to an online instance of Datasette running on Glitch</li>
<li>configure the Glitch instance to enable full text search on some of the fields</li>
</ul>
<p>The final output can be seen running at  <a href="https://watery-alder-carpenter.glitch.me/data/article">https://watery-alder-carpenter.glitch.me/data/article</a>.</p>
<p>Overall it went really well, and I&rsquo;m excited about Datasette.</p>

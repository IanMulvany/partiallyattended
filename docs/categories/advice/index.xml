      <description>Here is some advice I gave a few months ago to a friend on becoming a web dev. I think it still holds up.
The most important thing I have lots of advice, it I think the most important advice that I have boils down to do work. Build up a portfolio, and get comfortable and fluid with the tools that you will use to do web development.
We look for skilled passionate people, and the best way to show that, is to show projects that you have been working on.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s homepage cartoon today tells me that it&amp;rsquo;s Robert Bunsen&amp;rsquo;s birthday. He is famous for the invention of the burner named after him, but his contribution to our understanding of the universe around us runs much much deeper than that. He co-created the science of spectroscopy with Gustav Kirchhoff. This is something I learned about when I was living for a while in Heidelberg, one of the university building&amp;rsquo;s along the Hauptstrasse is named after Bunsen.</description>

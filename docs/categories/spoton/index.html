        I managed to squeeze in a few hours on Friday attending the spoton conference in London. I&rsquo;ve been at each one since 2008, and have had the good fortune to present something at most of them. This time I had been asked to sit in on a panel to talk about elife&rsquo;s policy around media relations, but as I was flying in that morning from an editorial board meeting held in Washington it was not clear to me that I would make it in time, so the fantastic @sciencescoops (Jennifer Mitchell) represented for eLife in my place.

        I&rsquo;ll keep a partial, live-idsh blog going during the day. I&rsquo;ve been going to these things, I think, since about 2008. I really like these meetings. I&rsquo;m going to probably keep these notes pretty lightweight.
sessions:  Ben Goldacre Kamila  Session on whether science journalism will be replaced Altmetric track  now on to the sessions!
Ben Goldacre - opening keynote, on data. .(top) Ben is talking about the issues that arise when you place a lot of data in one place.

      <description>Background. On Monday the 31st of March I attended the Cambridge PHP Meetup, the topic was BeHat testing. Johnathan Gough gave the talk.
This is something we are getting started with in eLife. We have a few small tests in place, we have a few regressions on the site that we want to tackle, and we are looking to use it as a way of pinning down requirements from the company for new features that we want to roll out.</description>

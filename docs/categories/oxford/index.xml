Last year I attended a one day seminar on Wittgenstein and Physics. It was held at Cross College Oxford and was the first in a planned series of talks on the history and philosophy of science. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve done physics seriously, and longer still since I took classes on the history and philosophy of science, so I attended very much in the mode of the interested outsider.</description>

      <description>Last week I was at the FORCE2015 conference. I enjoyed it greatly. This was the 2015 instance of the FORCE11/Beyond the pdf conference. I&amp;rsquo;d been aware of these meetings since the first one was announced back in 2011, but this was my first chance to attend one. (If I recall, I&amp;rsquo;d even been invited to the DagStuhl workshop, but had been unable to attend. I&amp;rsquo;d been to one DagStuhl workshop on science and social networks many years ago, and that had been one of the best short meetings that I&amp;rsquo;d ever attended, so I&amp;rsquo;d been sad not to be able to go to the Beyond the PDF meeting).</description>

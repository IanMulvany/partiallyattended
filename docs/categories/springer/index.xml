      <description>Springer have just launched a web app that lets you search for
locations of authors, AuthorMapper.Â They
have done this by building an XML database with the citation metadata
for all of their papers. You search for terms or authors and it will
generate a google map with the locations for your search terms, or
people. The site also has some other infoporn, including a histogram
for authors published by year for your search term.</description>

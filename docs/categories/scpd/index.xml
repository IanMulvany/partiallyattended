      <description>Distill is an experiment in bringing interactive documents and scholarly documents together. I&amp;rsquo;m often asked what the future of publishing might look like, and were we to embrace what the web offers it might look like distill.

The authors wanted to use surveys to get a sense of importance of the under served needs, but in the end had to resort to a simple variant of card sorting.</description>

        Well, it&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote up my climbing goals for 2010, and I totally missed doing this for last year, so as we ease our way into 2012 it&rsquo;s high time that I do the same again.
The key goals for 2010 were:

 onsight 6c+ indoors redpoint 6c outside boulder V4 a few HVS&rsquo;s  So, not quite breaking through to where I wanted to be, but there is a feeling of definite progress.

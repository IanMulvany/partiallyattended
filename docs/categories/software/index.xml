      <description>This is a short story about software, some of the things I hate about it, my lack of knowledge of ruby, and a desire to own my own words.
For various reasons I&amp;rsquo;m working on a brand new machine, I decided that I want to start posting to my own blog again (as well as cross posting to Medium, because fuck it, why not).
That involved dusting down my Jekyll site and seeing if I could get it to work again.</description>

      <title>Some thoughts about product management</title>

      <description>I moved into digital product management in 2007. I had no formal training, and for much of the last eight years I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning on the job. There are a huge number of resources out there, great lectures, books, conferences, blog posts. In this short post I just want to reflect a bit on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned on this topic through direct personal experience. I continue to learn, and my thinking continues to evolve, so this post is more of a look back, than a look to the future.</description>

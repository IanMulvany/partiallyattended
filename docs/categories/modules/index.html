                    Looking for algorithms to do community detection (there are a bunch from the famous Girvan-Newman algorithm doi:10.1073/pnas.122653799 which seems to have gained popularity through being very simple, effiencet and usually pretty powerfull, through to a method doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.71.046117 by Ziv, Middendorf and Wiggins. I have to admit I don't understand that paper yet, but hope to come back to it.) I was pointed to a paper by Guimera, Sales-Pardo and Amaral. In looking for the paper the first one that I found was Classes of complex networks deﬁned by role-to-role connectivity proﬁles on DOI:10.

                    Ensemble came out of the human genome project about 8 years ago to preventcommercialization of genomic data.
the idea was to have an open source human genome
companies would have to do some work before they could make money off ofsequences.
the ensemble projects takes the raw data from the genes and adds other datato this, such as reference data from other experiments
there is enemble codeand there is the data

suppliment the mark-up from publishers.
can draw the chemical and annotating them overlayed over the paper
some problems are that there can be new names in papers,comapct names, include extra hyphens, this program can deal with these kindsof things.
also can use systematics parsing.
this is the core technology, you can do things like search for alkloids inyour paper, or document dump

                    OS CMS systems beat the crap out of the free ones for what you get for your money, including support.
If you have a budget then you can get in touch with the authors of the OS systems easily
the only thing they sometimes don't win on is polish
it is someone's job to look at each piece and make sure that it is slick
Drupal is free, It upgrades about twice&#160; a year, one major one minor

so they built something
he just plugged in a microcontoler with a wireless sensorhis machine things that it's a flash drive
he dregged over a binarythe device started blinking, this is the hello world of hardware hacking,cool
what can you do now? well cool stuff obviously!
the other cool thing is that there is a compiler on a websiteso you can talk about things in the context that people imagine themthis is built on top of c++

                    what's cool about microformats web?
is it the stickers?the t-shirtsthe community process
urlb.at/2f
personal information disastertravel airlines don't talk to railroads
 microformats say, what problem does it solve?
 perhaps there is no problem at all
what problem does blogging solve?Twitter for christ's sake?
no one knows what they do until they are popular
e.g. yahoo pipes is not practical yetit is a user experience nightmareand it doesn't have a clear defined purpose

if you just let the domain experts create microformats you may leave theontologicaldefinitions to people who are creating the xslt

                    Matt talking about semanitic web for science, an introductionXML, URI, namespaces, RDL OWL,standards are often argued about but it;s just XML
we are supposed to be able to publish semantis data easily,at the moment it's not just an extension but a whole other world,people won't learn sapqrl
Matt believes that we can get the benifits of semantic now, but withoutin any case, it's hard to get funding
should consider semantic web, rather than Semantic Web,

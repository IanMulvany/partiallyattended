      <description> Yesterday one of the guy&#39;s at the office interviewed the producer of TheSimpsons. As a result he had to do quite a lot of research yesterday onSimsonalia, and decided to use the make your own simpson avatar tool on theSimpsons movie page to make all of us our own simpson character, this iswhat I would look like if I were a simpson.

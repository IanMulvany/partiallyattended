                    I don't post my poetry often, indeed I don't write often, but I thought this one came out OK. Written over the past weekend for a good friend on the occasion of her birthday.

Edinburgh, first draft, 01/05/2010
for andrea.
Was it in Summer, when I lost myself among the graveyards?
The moss covered steps of Greyfriars green and gleaming.
Or was it someone's winter night along cobbled streets, where buildings wear a sharp puritan cut to their overcoats?

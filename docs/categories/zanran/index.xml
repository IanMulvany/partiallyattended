      <description>Back in 2010 I was pointed at zanran, a search engine that looks for data in graphs.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with some sample searches, and decided to try drowning deaths swimming pool. Incidentally all of the results that came back were figures for young children. I guess this is because that is the group where there is the most concern, and so there is more published data about this group.</description>

      <description>Probabilistic language models, auto-correction tools and scientific discovery.
&#34;Durgesh Kumar Dwivedi&#34;:http://network.nature.com/people/U56CB3E51/profile over on Nature Network just asked &#34;Does anyone have any software or web address which corrects English grammar, preposition, edit and shortened the paragraphs?&#34;. This question brought to mind and idea that I had a few years ago.
The idea is simple enough, use a large corpus of pre-vetted grammatically correct text as a training tool to compare sentences against.</description>

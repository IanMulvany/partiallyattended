      <description>This week I attended futurepub10, I love these events, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a bunch, and the format of short talks, and lots of time to catchup with people is just great.
#Â A new Cartography of Collaboration - Daniel Hook, CEO Digital Science (work with Ian Calvert).
Digital science have produced a report on collaboration, and this talk was covering one of chapters from that.
I was interested to see what the key takeaways are that you can describe in a five minute talk.</description>

      <description>Tonight there was a lovely sameas event on the topic of serendipity. I&amp;rsquo;d stared a blog post about this back in May as a response to to a post that Frank Norman wrote about enablining serendipidous discovery in the digital library. Well, that post kind of lingered, malingered in my drafts directory, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d best get on get something out there, spurred on by the event tonight.
I studied in Edinburgh for a few years, it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city, and in the heart of the old town Victoria Street sweeps in a steep curve down to the cowgate.</description>

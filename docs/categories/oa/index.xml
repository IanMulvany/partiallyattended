      <description>I took a look at the T&amp;amp;F survey with interest. I&amp;rsquo;m also very aware of the concerns and confusions that exist around licensing. I&amp;rsquo;m also aware of the &amp;ldquo;one size doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit all&amp;rdquo; argument.
I&amp;rsquo;ll address the T&amp;amp;F survey first, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly discuss CC-BY pros and cons, purely from the point of view of my own understanding of these issues - I might be very wrong on this.</description>

      <description>There are three bills up for consideration in the US Government which if passed will have a significant negative impact on academic research. These are the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), the Protect IP Act (PIPA), and the Research Works Act (RWA).
SOPA and PIPA will have a negative impact by putting censorship controls into the hands of the entertainment industry, and permitting legal process to affect the underlying architecture of the web.</description>

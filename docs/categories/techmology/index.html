        A few weeks ago I was at the aannual Rave publishing technology conference. It&rsquo;s always an interesting event to attend.
My main recollection from last year was the interest in blockchain.
This year, as I reflect on how I feel about the meeting, I think I have two main things that have stayed with me.
The first was the appeal from Tasha to ask us as a community and an industry to do more to think about removing barriers for early career researchers.

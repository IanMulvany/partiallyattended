      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m attending this event today, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep some notes as the day progresses. There are a couple of oddities about the event:
 No Coffee. That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a pity No power outlets in the conference room. Not many conferences have that, but one would think that it is a no brainer, especially for any meeting about the web, and in particular linked data. To add to that, there also seems to be no public wifi.</description>

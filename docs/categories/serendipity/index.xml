      <description>Tonight there was a lovely sameas event on the topic of serendipity. I&amp;rsquo;d stared a blog post about this back in May as a response to to a post that Frank Norman wrote about enablining serendipidous discovery in the digital library. Well, that post kind of lingered, malingered in my drafts directory, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d best get on get something out there, spurred on by the event tonight.
I studied in Edinburgh for a few years, it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city, and in the heart of the old town Victoria Street sweeps in a steep curve down to the cowgate.</description>

      <description>This post was mostly written earlier this summer, in the days after I had finished reading a book.
I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished reading W. G. Seabald&amp;rsquo;s Vertigo. This is the second of his books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read over the last decade, and it is as haunting as the first. The first of his I read was The rings of Saturn.
Towards the closing pages of the book I was filled with a great expectation that I might possibly experience some deep revelation.</description>

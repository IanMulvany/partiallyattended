      <description>So this morning I had a scan with a consultant and he has diagnosed me with Dupuytren&amp;rsquo;s Contracture. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a climber since the summer of 1990, nearly 22 years now. It&amp;rsquo;s been amazing, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten into some pretty special situations, and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten pretty fit. There is some evidence that there is a higher incedence of Dupuytren&amp;rsquo;s Contracture amongst climbers. There is a great write up about a climbers experience of this condition on ukclimbing.</description>

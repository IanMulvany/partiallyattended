        (This was from Sunday)
In an attempt to get over the jet lag, myself and Dave headed over to San Francisco yesterday, we had a good walk around, got lost twice, and then met pup with the lovely Ariel Waldman. I had to drop off some mendeley schwag for the upcoming San Francisco science hack day that Ariel is organising (we are giving a little sponsorship, yay!). It&rsquo;s going to take place in two weeks, and it looks lie it&rsquo;s going to be an awesome event.

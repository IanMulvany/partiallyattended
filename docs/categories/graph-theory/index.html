                    CANCELLED Due to flight cancellations out of NY, Chris won&rsquo;t be making it over to this side of the pond, so sadly we will be calling the event off.
London is a great city to live in if you are interested in technology. It has to be one of the best cities in the world for people working on the interface between science, tech and te web. Tonight I&rsquo;ll be going to the awesome Same As Christmass Quiz, and tomorrow night Chris Wiggins will be passing through from New York, and there will be a chance to meet up with him for a pint and a chat.

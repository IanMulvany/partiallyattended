      <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about neat ways to make blogs approach research articles; about how to make some of the core features of a journal be more apparent in a blog, which has led me to think about blogger widgets. That led me to the Phydeaux3 blog where there is a kick ass implementation of a widget to display a tag cloud for blogger. Hopefully you can see that it works pretty well.</description>

        Discussing Open Access http://discussingoa.wordpress.com/
I read through this piece by Rick Anderson. It&rsquo;s a very good piece. It does an excellent job of articulating some of the challenges of subscription publishing and of various forms of open access publishing.
I have a couple of relativly minor issues with it.
The impression I got from reading it was that OA advocates are more shouty and incapable of a serious debate on the issue than advocates of a subscription model, and possibly those who pursue subscription models are more open minded.

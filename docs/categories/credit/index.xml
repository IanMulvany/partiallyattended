      <description>I sat down with Richard Wynne. Richard has a long career in the publishing space, having been one of the senior team at Aries for a long time.
Over the last year Richard has founded Rescognito. Rescognito is a service to allow institutions or individuals to award credits (or rescogs ) to anyone for anything within the scholarly ecosystem. You can reward article contributions, reviews, presentations, knowledge, providing open data. The schema is extendible, so if you have a particular use-case in mind it could be accommodated.</description>

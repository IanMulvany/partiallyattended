      <description>This is a very nice overview of how to create a clear business case for design work, but the general approach of walking a tree to find leverage points to build up the argument can be applied any time that you want to make a business case.</description>

      <description>Sophie Freiermuth(@wickedgeekie)) from Baguette UX gave tonight&amp;rsquo;s talk on how lessons learnt from operating as a UXer within an agile environment. I thought it was a great talk. When at Mendeley we always faced the problem of trying to square the challenge to fitting an inherently creative process into the systems that emerged while we attempted to adopt agile processes, in my time there we learnt a lot, we had some success and some areas where we obviously needed to learn more, so I was delighted to hear a very thoughtful presentation from the perspective of someone who it seems has worked with quite a few teams implementing agile in a variety of flavours.</description>

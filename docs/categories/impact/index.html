        The start of December is always a busy time for news in the STM / Product space. There is the annual STM meeting in London, and AWS re-invent also kicks off this week. As a result, within just a few days, I find that I have more things to write about than I can ever possibly have time to get through before the end of the year, we must plough on, and plough on we will.

        I’ve finally gotten around to looking at the report that Kudos developed earlier this year looking into where research outputs go to, and where they get consumed, after they have been published.
You get grab a copy of the report here How to build a global, engaged audience for your research..
The report is based on a survey of 10k researchers, supported with interviews and desk research.
It’s a short read (19 pages), so go ahead and grab the report and have a look.

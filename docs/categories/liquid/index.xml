      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently moved my blog over to hosting on github using the Jekyll templating system. I was intrigued by the ability of Jekyll to create a listing for related posts, but in the end the quality was poor. There are two methods avilable, the more robust uses latent semantic indexing, but this is not supported by github. I can understand this, as the processing required is a bit too much of an overhead for a lightweight hosting service.</description>

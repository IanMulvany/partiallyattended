                    Last week I was at the FORCE2015 conference. I enjoyed it greatly. This was the 2015 instance of the FORCE11/Beyond the pdf conference. I&rsquo;d been aware of these meetings since the first one was announced back in 2011, but this was my first chance to attend one. (If I recall, I&rsquo;d even been invited to the DagStuhl workshop, but had been unable to attend. I&rsquo;d been to one DagStuhl workshop on science and social networks many years ago, and that had been one of the best short meetings that I&rsquo;d ever attended, so I&rsquo;d been sad not to be able to go to the Beyond the PDF meeting).

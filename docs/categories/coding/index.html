        CODECHECK is a fascinating service - https://codecheck.org.uk/ That creates a workflow for academics to provide feedback on research code. The project is being led by Stephen Eglen and and Daniel NÃ¼st.
They describe what they do succinctly as
 CODECHECK is a process for independent reproduction of computations and awarding of time-stamped certificates for successful reproductions of scholarly articles.
 Checking software in research is a significant challenge, and I really like CODECHECK because it is an initiative that has emerged from researchers themselves.

                    Back at the beginning of August I gave a talk at the American Phytopathological Society. It was a great opportunity to talk to some really interesting scientists. My talk slides are below.

                    Last Saturday at Science Online London I gave a quick tutorial on YQL, and how it might be used to mash up scientific data sets. Below I list some of the sample queries that I was playing with. Before you get started with the console have a look through the documentation. I got a lot of milage out of the part about filters and joins. The blog post by Paul Hogan on using YQL for library maships was also very helpful.

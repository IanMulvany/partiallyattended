      <description>I was having a conversation last week with a good friend who works in the financial services sector. We were discussing technical debt, and the tendency of certain teams to want to do everything themselves. He described some colleagues in a team that is tasked with managing a large data pipeline for calculation of risks in a particular market. This is central to the bottom line of the company. Oh, they also used to run their own mailing list server!</description>

      <description>In order to check mail less frequently than the options available, following a hint from macosxhints:
 set up an applescript to tell mail to check for mail. put that script under a launchd deamon with an interval use lingon to setup the deamon  so far it seems to be working, yay!

      <description>This week I attended futurepub10, I love these events, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a bunch, and the format of short talks, and lots of time to catchup with people is just great.
# A new Cartography of Collaboration - Daniel Hook, CEO Digital Science (work with Ian Calvert).
Digital science have produced a report on collaboration, and this talk was covering one of chapters from that.
I was interested to see what the key takeaways are that you can describe in a five minute talk.</description>

      <description>This is the second #futurepub event that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. I also attended the last one
The event was hosted by Nesta. Nesta have just launched the &amp;ldquo;new longitude&amp;rdquo; prize - which looks pretty interesting. There were six rapid fire talks, and I found the presentation format to be excellent. As with the previous event, this one was organised by the WriteLaTeX guys, and I&amp;rsquo;d just like to extend a big thanks to them for again putting on a great little event.</description>

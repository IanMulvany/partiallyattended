      <description>I got asked to contribute an answer to an upcoming feature looking at trends in scholarly discovery.
There are four questions and Iâ€™ve been asked to think about an answer to the last of these four.

For a researcher, how has the discovery experience developed in recent years?
How can researchers decide which tools are going to do the right job for them?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at the Charleston conference, my first time, and we had a panel discussion this morning talking about AI.
On the panel were:
Heather Staines Director of Partnerships, Hypothes.is
Peter Brantley Director of Online Strategy, UC Davis
Elizabeth Caley Chief of Staff, Meta, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
Ruth Pickering Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Yewno
and myself. It was a pleasure to be on a panel with these amazing people.</description>

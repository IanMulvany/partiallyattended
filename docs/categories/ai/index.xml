      <description>The Verge also covered this well: www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17334658/google-ai-phone-call-assistant-duplex-ethical-social-implications and they have a quote from Joanna Bryson, who talked at SAGE just before Christmas. Her quote is finished out with the following.
 There are no obvious answers to these questions, but as Bryson points out, Google is at least doing the world a service by bringing attention to this technology. It’s not the only company developing these services, and it certainly won’t be the only one to use them.</description>

      <description>I got asked to contribute an answer to an upcoming feature looking at trends in scholarly discovery.
There are four questions and I’ve been asked to think about an answer to the last of these four.
 In a sentence or two, please tell us what you understand is meant by &amp;lsquo;discovery&amp;rsquo;?
For a researcher, how has the discovery experience developed in recent years?
How can researchers decide which tools are going to do the right job for them?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at the Charleston conference, my first time, and we had a panel discussion this morning talking about AI.
On the panel were:
Heather Staines Director of Partnerships, Hypothes.is
Peter Brantley Director of Online Strategy, UC Davis
Elizabeth Caley Chief of Staff, Meta, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
Ruth Pickering Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Yewno
and myself. It was a pleasure to be on a panel with these amazing people.</description>

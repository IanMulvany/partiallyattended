      <description>  I visited my girlfriend in Germany this weekend, and her father wascelebrating his 60th birthday. A friend of his arranged a full wild boarfrom the German forests. The spit it and slow cooked it for 7 hours, ittasted amazing. I can quite see why Asterix and friends got so excited aboutthis.

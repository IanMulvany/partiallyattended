      <description>I just posted the below as a comment on a blog, but it was good so I thoughtI&#39;d repost here

At a fundamental level &#39;the system&#39; is how we ascribe credit toparticipation in science. The credit is converted to grant money, thedollars keep the food on the plate.</description>

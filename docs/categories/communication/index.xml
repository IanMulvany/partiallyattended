      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using virtualenv for a while, but in the past few months, since taking up the role of head of technology for eLife, I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving much more thought about how to build scalable development environments.
Ever since I was managing connotea, one of the biggest pains has been configuration management. I seem to have spent almost more time on configuring environments than on actually doing any development work (disclaimer, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually do much coding, I usually do more product management, but it&amp;rsquo;s really useful to know the development pain points).</description>

        On Friday I hosted a session at Science Online London. Michael Habibi, Richard Wallis and Chris Taylor all gave great presentations. Michael&rsquo;s presentation and Richards&rsquo;s presentation are both online, and when the organisers post the other talks I&rsquo;ll link to Chris&rsquo;s presentation too.
Michael, taking us through his talk Richard has a rapt audience Chris, getting passionate

        Last Saturday at Science Online London I gave a quick tutorial on YQL, and how it might be used to mash up scientific data sets. Below I list some of the sample queries that I was playing with. Before you get started with the console have a look through the documentation. I got a lot of milage out of the part about filters and joins. The blog post by Paul Hogan on using YQL for library maships was also very helpful.

        I&rsquo;m going to be hosting a session at science online London next weekend, I&rsquo;m excited. I&rsquo;ve been interested in the issues of connecting scientific data for a long time. In the last six months I&rsquo;ve become particularly excited about the potential of web based tool like Yahoo Query Language. I was hoping to talk a little about that, but I&rsquo;ve been lucky to get some amazing people to come and share their experiences about linking data, so I&rsquo;m going to cede the floor to them.

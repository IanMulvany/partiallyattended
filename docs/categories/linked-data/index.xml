      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m attending this event today, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep some notes as the day progresses. There are a couple of oddities about the event:
 No Coffee. That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a pity No power outlets in the conference room. Not many conferences have that, but one would think that it is a no brainer, especially for any meeting about the web, and in particular linked data. To add to that, there also seems to be no public wifi.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be hosting a session at science online London next weekend, I&amp;rsquo;m excited. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in the issues of connecting scientific data for a long time. In the last six months I&amp;rsquo;ve become particularly excited about the potential of web based tool like Yahoo Query Language. I was hoping to talk a little about that, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky to get some amazing people to come and share their experiences about linking data, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to cede the floor to them.</description>

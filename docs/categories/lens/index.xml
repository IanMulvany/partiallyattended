      <description>On 2015-01-27 I gave one of the short talks at the FuturePub event. My slidedeck is here. I wanted to give a quick update on where the Lens viewer for research articles is heading. Lens is a great platform for experimentation, and we have been iterating on some ideas towards the end of 2014 that have now made it into the 2.0 release.
The main update is that Lens can now be configured to accept information from a 3rd party source and display that information in the right hand resources pane.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m at the STM innovations seminar. The twitter tag for today is #ukinno. The program is online.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a light approach to blogging today, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably hang out mostly on Twitter.

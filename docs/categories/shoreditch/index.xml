      <description>I was bouldering yesterday. At my local block - a lump of granite embedded in the middle of shore ditch park. I&amp;rsquo;ve been climbing on this block pretty much since the week it was put in place.
Yesterday I saw that a hold I&amp;rsquo;d never noticed had been chalked up. It&amp;rsquo;s a great hold, at about shoulder height. It fits that pads of two and a half fingers, and in spite of being quite small, it feels pretty positive.</description>

      <description>This post was mostly written earlier this summer, in the days after I had finished reading a book.
I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished reading W. G. Seabald&amp;rsquo;s Vertigo. This is the second of his books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read over the last decade, and it is as haunting as the first. The first of his I read was The rings of Saturn.
Towards the closing pages of the book I was filled with a great expectation that I might possibly experience some deep revelation.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been almost a week since I got back from Fontainbleau. It was, as usual, a magical trip. Were took advantage of the row of bank holidays to get in a nice long spell in the forest without having to take too much time off work.
I&amp;rsquo;d been training like a fair old bastard in order to get fit for Marie Rose, but in the end a couple of injuries stopped me going near the route, which was a pity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about to head to Fontainbleau for another short climbing trip. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going there since 2003, this will be my 10th anniversary of going to font.
The first time I went there I brought a lot of expectations with me. I was climbing pretty well and I fully expected that I should be able to run up problems of about font 6a. I think I fell off of that first 3a 6 times before I got it.</description>

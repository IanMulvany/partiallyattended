        I’ve finally gotten around to looking at the report that Kudos developed earlier this year looking into where research outputs go to, and where they get consumed, after they have been published.
You get grab a copy of the report here How to build a global, engaged audience for your research..
The report is based on a survey of 10k researchers, supported with interviews and desk research.
It’s a short read (19 pages), so go ahead and grab the report and have a look.

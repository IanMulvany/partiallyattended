        Literature Data integration workshop 2012-10-10 There are many people attending today. I&rsquo;m not sure whether the attendee list will be released. I&rsquo;ve taken notes, but rather rapidly.

I still need to check on the links, and pull together a link list at the bottom, but I wanted to get the write up out while it was still in front of me.

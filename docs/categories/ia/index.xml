      <description>This talk happened a few weeks ago now, but the topic is timeless, so there is no harm in getting my notes up a bit late. Anna Dahlstrom(@annadahlstrom) came up to Cambridge to give a talk on how to design better UX deliverables, but more broadly the talk had many lessons about how to present results to different stakeholders, not just for UX.
A litte bit about Anna Anna had gone from only working with HMRC to working agency side - multiple clients, multiple project, different industries.</description>

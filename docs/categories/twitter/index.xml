      <description>So this morning I had a scan with a consultant and he has diagnosed me with Dupuytren&amp;rsquo;s Contracture. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a climber since the summer of 1990, nearly 22 years now. It&amp;rsquo;s been amazing, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten into some pretty special situations, and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten pretty fit. There is some evidence that there is a higher incedence of Dupuytren&amp;rsquo;s Contracture amongst climbers. There is a great write up about a climbers experience of this condition on ukclimbing.</description>

      <description> I&#39;m a Sci-Foo lurker, as I didn&#39;t make the cut to go this year, but I&#39;vebeen lapping up the news seeping out of the meeting. So far my favoriteTwitter post about the meeting comes from Richard Ackerman&#39;s feed:
&amp;quot;Timo and Tim are trying to kill us. Doesn&#39;t cult brainwashing start withsleep deprivation? Fun so far, anyway&amp;quot;

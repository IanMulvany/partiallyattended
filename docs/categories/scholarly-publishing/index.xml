      <description>eLife is trying another experiment in peer review. When they launched back in 2012 they introduced a form of peer review known as consultative peer review. They are now looking at a new iteration on the peer review idea.
Trials in how peer review is done are quite rare, so I think this is going to be interesting to keep track of.
The new idea is that once an article has been accepted for full review by one of the editors, the journal is going to publish the article, along with all comments.</description>

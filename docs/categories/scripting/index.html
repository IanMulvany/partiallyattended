                    I&rsquo;ve been changing the static blog generator that I use and am slowly moving from Jekyll to Hugo. My main reason is the better support for tags and categories that Hugo supports, but I&rsquo;m not finding the templating as intuitive in Hugo as in Jekyll, so it&rsquo;s not a slam-dunk.
There are a couple of small differences between the two systems that are making me reconfigure my blogging workflow a bit.

                    Last Saturday at Science Online London I gave a quick tutorial on YQL, and how it might be used to mash up scientific data sets. Below I list some of the sample queries that I was playing with. Before you get started with the console have a look through the documentation. I got a lot of milage out of the part about filters and joins. The blog post by Paul Hogan on using YQL for library maships was also very helpful.

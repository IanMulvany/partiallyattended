      <description>I use git a lot, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty complicated, and it has a lot of command line optoins that I can never remember. I&amp;rsquo;ve copied a couple of shortcuts from the web, and here are two that I use a lot. These are presented in the form of fish shell scripts.
 function gl git log &amp;ndash;graph &amp;ndash;abbrev-commit &amp;ndash;decorate &amp;ndash;date=relative &amp;ndash;format=format:&amp;lsquo;%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash;all end</description>

The very first thing to die on it&amp;rsquo;s own, without the intervention of an outside agent, was an organism called Volvox. The first life that we know of whose cells perish from old age, rather than misfortune. Before humble Volvox all other living things would go on forever, the immortal bacteria, the barely describable virus. Volvox introduced death by natural causes to the world, and all living things that came after that were as complex, or more so, followed suit, and found programmed within them some pace maker, set to expire after they had done their duty on the earth.</description>

        A few weeks ago I was at the aannual Rave publishing technology conference. It&rsquo;s always an interesting event to attend.
My main recollection from last year was the interest in blockchain.
This year, as I reflect on how I feel about the meeting, I think I have two main things that have stayed with me.
The first was the appeal from Tasha to ask us as a community and an industry to do more to think about removing barriers for early career researchers.

        I took some notes on some of the sessions at the conference yesterday.
Dave Smith - object oriented publishing. Dave makes a good case here about how we should think about the future of scholarly publishing â€” in terms of objects that can be reformed based on the needs and competencies of the readers. He points out that while we do have in place good ontologies and domain models, our entire view of publishing and our publishing infrastructures, remain laggy and are a barrier to moving in this direction.

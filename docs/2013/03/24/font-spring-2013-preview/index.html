          <p>I&rsquo;m about to head to Fontainbleau for another short climbing trip. I&rsquo;ve been going there since 2003, this will be my 10th anniversary of going to font.</p>
<p>The first time I went there I brought a lot of expectations with me. I was climbing pretty well and I fully expected that I should be able to run up problems of about font 6a. I think I fell off of that first 3a 6 times before I got it. It must have been years before I got any problem of 5 or harder.</p>
<p>I really was never sure that I ever would climb something as hard as a font 6. It seemed beyond a level that I would be able to do.</p>
<p>Eventually in 2010 I climbed a verifiable font 6a - le surplomb du lepreaux at elephant.</p>
<p>In all that time, all the years I&rsquo;ve been going, there has been one climb that has represented a level to aspire to - la Marie rose, the first 6a in the world. I&rsquo;ve been falling off it for about six years now. Going into <a href="http://partiallyattended.com/2013/03/24/font-spring-2011/">my last trip</a> I was confident. It didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going again next week.</p>
<p>In the last six months I&rsquo;ve done over 300 bouldering problems in the gym. I&rsquo;ve done more fingerboard sessions targeted at improving my strength on slopers, than ever before. I&rsquo;ve done more v4s in 2013 in the gym than in all other years combined.</p>
<p>Fuck it, there really is no more that I could have done in preparation for the upcoming trip. I&rsquo;m going to try la Marie rose again, and I might get it this year, or I might not. The conditions might be great, it might rain.</p>
<p>The one thing I know is that this time when I try it, there will be no excuses, and I won&rsquo;t have any regrets over my preparation. I hope I get it, and honestly I&rsquo;m nervous that I might not, but I&rsquo;m really happy with my training and I&rsquo;m really really looking  forward to measuring it up against reality.</p>
<p>There are a few bouldering problems lurking in the world, one took me 10 years to do, one 18 solid months of effort, trying almost every week. Marie Rose is a wonderful project, this boulder will be there, I&rsquo;ll do it or I won&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;ll probably keep coming back to it, hopefully for the next 10 years at least. I hope I get it.</p>

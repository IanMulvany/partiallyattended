<h1 id="212-climbing-review">212 climbing review.</h1>

<p>OK, time to review the year. I wrote out some <a href="http://partiallyattended.com/2012/01/08/climbing-goals-2012/">goals</a> at the start of last year.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2012-were">Goals for 2012 were</h2>

<ul>
<li>remain injury free (<strong>not done</strong>)</li>
<li>significantly reduce the amount of alcohol that I consume (<strong>done</strong>)</li>
<li>fall off at least 10 routes of 6c or harder/month (<strong>not done</strong>)</li>
<li>redpoint 7a, but don&rsquo;t stop trying harder things (<strong>not done</strong>)</li>
<li>get three campus board sessions or power hand sessions into my training per month (<strong>done</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>My training diary from 2011 looked like:</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tHGUcS8CNkulh-nGJ1XDSdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tnkZpwNAT7k/Twok31B4M1I/AAAAAAAAAuI/QhsfYB8WWeA/s400/screen-capture.jpg" height="264" width="400" /></a></p>

<p>And for 2012 it looked like:</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/102755743034732738536/January82013#5830993441605081682"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GzFhn0woQbY/UOvZpCaA2lI/AAAAAAAAucA/e6qrmkMKsuA/s800/Screenshot_08_01_2013_08_21.jpg" height="264" width="400" /></a></p>

<p>There were two large disruptions to my climbing this year:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://partiallyattended.com/2012/06/26/go-fuck-yourself/">I was diagnosed with Dupteron&rsquo;s contracture</a>, leaving a three month gap where I did no climbing.</li>
<li>I had a wonderful baby son.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key effects were that I prioritised away from routes to bouldering for the second half of 2012. It also meant that I had far fewer trips out than in previous years, with only a few short day trips in January, and one afternoon trying a famous bouldering problem in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>I also bought a beastmaker 1000, and started to use it regularly.</p>

<h2 id="bouldering-tally">Bouldering tally</h2>

<p>In 2011 my bouldering tally looked like:</p>

<p>total ~ 250<br />
v3 - 55<br />
v4 - 8<br />
v5 - 0</p>

<p>And in 2012 it looked like:</p>

<p>total - 322<br />
V2  86<br />
V3  90<br />
V4  19<br />
V5  2</p>

<h2 id="climbing-highlights">Climbing highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>born free in Swanage, fr 6b+, one of the best lines I&rsquo;ve ever climbed. I tried it in 2011, and didn&rsquo;t get it clean. This time I didn&rsquo;t feel as strong on the route, but I knew what was coming and I did it.</li>
<li>making real progress in my bouldering</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals-for-2013">Goals for 2013</h2>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s time to set some goals. I&rsquo;ll try and use SMART metrics this time - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely. The main trip that I have planned for 2013 will be a trip to font, so that also provides a good anchor for goals for this year. I&rsquo;ll also try to tie long term goals for 2013 with &ldquo;now-actions&rdquo; that move me towards those long term goals.</p>

<h3 id="smart-goals-for-2013">SMART goals for 2013</h3>

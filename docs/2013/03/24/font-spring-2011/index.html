          <p>Well, it&rsquo;s been almost a week since I got back from Fontainbleau. It was, as usual, a magical trip. Were took advantage of the row of bank holidays to get in a nice long spell in the forest without having to take too much time off work.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5181/5685509661_68977e7df5_z.jpg" alt="Trying a problem in Fontainbleau." title="bouldering" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been training like a fair old bastard in order to get fit for Marie Rose, but in the end a couple of injuries stopped me going near the route, which was a pity. The first injury really dropped by level of confidence and motivation,
but a couple of good ticks during the rest of the week, and a read of the &lsquo;art of mastery&rsquo; pulled me out of my mini-cycle of depression and got me all rearing to go again.</p>

<p>Firstly, a quick description of the two injuries, on the morning of the second day I suffered a hyper extension injury on my left knee. I could hobble around camp a bit painfully the next morning, and knew the game was somewhat up. I rested and iced it for two days, and then got back to climbing, though a good bit more tentatively than I&rsquo;d been hoping.</p>

<p>It help up well for the rest of the week, and I&rsquo;ve just been to see am Osteopath of all people, who had given be a all clear on the injury (will continue to be sore for a little while, but continued icing and moderate exercise should see a rapid and full recovery, yay!).</p>

<p>The second injury was just dumb. It happened on the second day that I was back on climbing after the rest from the knee injury. I was on a pretty precarious top out, though I had a clean landing and loads of spotters and loads of mats I panicked. I slapped really really hard for a flat finishing hold and bruised the shit out of my right index finger. It was really big. I thought I&rsquo;d rightly buggered it. One of the people spotting me was a Sheffield bloke out in the forest with his wife and family. He got me to tape the finger, wrap it around a cold bottle for a few moments, and try the damn problem again, so I dutifully did, with a bit of doubt in my mind, and this time I pulled over the top with a bit more care. Finger still hurt like fuck though.</p>

<p>By the end of the trip I was a bit of a walking wreck, but it was an amazing tip.</p>

<p>The climbing hi-lights were:</p>

<ul>
<li>watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/25928351">Gioia flow gracefully across a 5c+</a> that no-one else could do</li>
<li>doing the entire 53 orange problems at 91.1 with only 7 falls (the jingo wobbly challenge in the bag). <a href="http://vimeo.com/23389690">The feat mad Conor bow down at my feet</a>.</li>
<li>getting my first font 6b, and maybe doing a second on the same trip!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing a complete circuit in a day with Mike was magical, and one of the best climbing days of my life. 53 problems, over 250m of ascent. It was a dream.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that I need to improve some foot technique, some flexibility and some core strength, so I&rsquo;m going to start a Yoga class, probably from next week on. I&rsquo;m pretty strong, fingers could get stronger, to be sure, but core strength and stability at the moment is much more important.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to go back. Some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mulvanynet/sets/72157626641391660/">photos</a>.</p>

          <p>I must have been fourteen, fifteen years old, I was passing through a train station in Northern Ireland and I picked up a copy of Mort, from that point on I was hooked. How could it not speak to me, a gangly awkward teenager, trying to find my way in the world. I devoured the books as they came out, within a few more years I had a healthy stack.</p>
<p>By that time I&rsquo;d started going to scifi conventions and the great man was doing a signing at one around the corner from where I grew up. Diligently I brought my stack, stood in line and he looked up, saw my stack of books. I said &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the people behind you that you have to worry about. What&rsquo;s the dedication?&rdquo;
&ldquo;To ian&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>And so it began</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Ian&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;To Ian, best wishes&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;To Ian, superior felicitations&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;To Ian, with the return of the best wishes from 20000 leagues from beneath the sea&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years and years later, nighttime drawing in, I&rsquo;d read those books to the person who is now my wife. Soon her knowledge of all things disk outstripped even mine, then the audiobooks. It&rsquo;s a surprise to me that our son escaped being called Horace.</p>

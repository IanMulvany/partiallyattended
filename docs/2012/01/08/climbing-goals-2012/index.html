          <p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote up my <a href="http://partiallyattended.com/2010/01/04/Climbing-Goals-2010-review-2009/">climbing goals for 2010</a>, and I totally missed doing this for last year,
so as we ease our way into 2012 it&rsquo;s high time that I do the same again.</p>
<p>The key goals for 2010 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>redpoint fr 7a</li>
<li>boulder V5</li>
<li>trad E1</li>
<li>some trips to do some trad climbing</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, since then I achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>onsight 6c+ indoors</li>
<li>redpoint 6c outside</li>
<li>boulder V4</li>
<li>a few HVS&rsquo;s</li>
</ul>
<p>So, not quite breaking through to where I wanted to be, but there is a feeling of definite progress.</p>
<h1 id="2011-hi-lights">2011 hi-lights:</h1>
<ul>
<li>font 6b, at fontainbleau</li>
<li>6c sport climb at Portland</li>
</ul>
<p>Alltogether it was an OK year even though I have still not sent La Marie Rose, but if you contrast my <a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/e.php?d=2012&amp;u=41852">training diary</a> between 2010:</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oK47rfPQ8Et3ouZa96aZLNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xeSbDtLcsfI/Twok3TMJB7I/AAAAAAAAAuE/pnmoQnc6r8I/s144/screen-capture-1.jpg" height="264" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>and 2011:</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tHGUcS8CNkulh-nGJ1XDSdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tnkZpwNAT7k/Twok31B4M1I/AAAAAAAAAuI/QhsfYB8WWeA/s400/screen-capture.jpg" height="264" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>you can see a big hole in the middle of 2011 where I took time off to refit my kitchen. The second half of 2012 will also be very distrupted from a climing point of view
(though with some very good reasons that I am very much looking forward to).</p>
<p>Today at the Castle I maanged to fire off a 6c, and 6c+, the 6c+ being on-sight. I&rsquo;ve decided that my:</p>
<h1 id="goals-for-2012-are-as-follows">Goals for 2012 are as follows:</h1>
<ul>
<li>remain injury free</li>
<li>significantly reduce the amount of alcohol that I consume</li>
<li>fall off at least 10 routes of 6c or harder/month</li>
<li>redpoint 7a, but don&rsquo;t stop trying harder things</li>
<li>get three campus board sessions or power hand sessions into my training per month</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part what I have realised is that what I have control over are the things I choose to do when I go training. If I can keep focussed on
making sure that I don&rsquo;t have any anxiety about what I am trying to climb, and that I am really pushing myself and my body, then the grades and routes will
come naturally. I want to climb hard, but I don&rsquo;t want to set goals that will lead me to focus on that one climb, rather I want to focus on making
the journey and the process a good journey, that is using my time in a very efficient way.</p>

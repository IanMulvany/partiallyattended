          <p>The awesome <a href="http://iphylo.blogspot.com/">Rod Page</a> has a great post on utilising Mendeley as a bank for citation data. He recommends that projects such as the <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> should build on top of the kind of infrastructure that we have already created at Mendeley. I&rsquo;m a big fan of this as an idea, and indeed one of my goals for Mendeley is for us to create a system that makes it easier for others to build great tools for researchers. I began down a research career, but left it quite early. Making things that help researchers gives me a huge amount of personal satisfaction.</p>

<p>I think there are three things that we should strive for that would really help with this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Better example documentation on our API.</li>
<li>More clarity around the provenance of metadata on our catalog pages.</li>
<li>A more robust framework for storing, displaying and sharing PDFs where such sharing is allowed.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was fascinated in particular by the <a href="http://worldcat.org/xissn/titlehistory">Worldcat tool on displaying the historical changes of an ISSN</a>. I aspire to being able to show provenance data on citation information in as clear a way as Worldcat have done here.</p>

<p>Just things to keep in mind going forward.</p>

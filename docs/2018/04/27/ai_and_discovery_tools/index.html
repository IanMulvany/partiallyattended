          <p>I got asked to contribute an answer to an upcoming feature looking at trends in scholarly discovery.</p>
<p>There are four questions and I’ve been asked to think about an answer to the last of these four.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a sentence or two, please tell us what you understand is meant by &lsquo;discovery&rsquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a researcher, how has the discovery experience developed in recent years?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How can researchers decide which tools are going to do the right job for them?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is more important for researchers – the overall breadth of data coverage offered by a particular discovery tool, or the user experience?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With an eye on AI and machine learning, what developments are likely to be important over the next year or two?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, what kind of trends might we see in AI / Machine learning over the next 12 to 24 months.  Well, my answer to that question is currently under embargo, but I’ll reveal all shortly.</p>

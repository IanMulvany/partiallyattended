<p>I just had my first hands on experience with the Microsoft surface hub. I tried out sketching a lean canvas on the surface to see how it would work.</p>

<h3 id="things-i-liked">Things I liked</h3>

<ul>
<li>writing was responsive</li>
<li>pressure sensitivity worked well</li>
<li>two people can write at the same time</li>
<li>there is sketch to shape recognition, and it’s OK</li>
<li>its just about big enough to work on, but bigger would be better</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-i-liked-in-principle-but-was-not-able-to-check-whether-they-work-in-practice">Things I liked in principle, but was not able to check whether they work in practice</h3>

<ul>
<li>being able to capture the output of the session digitally</li>
<li>being able to remotely work on the surface with another team at the same time</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-i-didn-t-like">Things I didn’t like</h3>

<ul>
<li>selecting and moving items really just was too hard to figure out</li>
<li>under / erase was fiddly</li>
<li>sometimes the built in grid would get in the way</li>
<li>when I had object recognition on, it would sometimes turn my “D”s into triangles</li>
<li>not as flexible as working with post it notes, in terms of being able to move and cluster ideas</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall this is getting there, but for me its not quite there yet. Many of the things that I thought would be natural interactions with the sketches that I created just didn’t work. I think the hardware is where it needs to be, but a few generations advance with the software could turn this from being frustrating to being delightful. At the moment I think trying to use this in a meeting right now would be more distracting than helpful, over the alternatives of just using paper artefacts.</p>

          <p>This is a fascinating post on what dynamics are in place between large companies and developers. The bottom line is that Microsoft has had to pay a large sum (&gt;$7B) to acquire a developer friendly platform because they currently don&rsquo;t really have one. In contrast Apple has a lot of leverage over developers on iOS, but not on other platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there is a connection to researchers in the STM space, but some journals certainly have a lot of leverage over researchers. Who is going to build the &ldquo;researcher friendly&rdquo; platform, how much will they have to pay for that, and will it be able to provide an ROI?</p>

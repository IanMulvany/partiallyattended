          <p>Open knowledge maps show the relationship between different papers, based on a keyword search. They have been gong for some time now (originally built on top of Mendeley data). I ran into them again this week as we start to think about how to visualise the relationship between different aspects of research. The one linked to here is for social science and here is one for &ldquo;computational social science&rdquo;: <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/map/70627a849484345cdfd04c914de0a2e2">https://openknowledgemaps.org/map/70627a849484345cdfd04c914de0a2e2</a>. Their news pages shows that the project and team are still active, which is great. For a quick dip into a topic they are useful, but I don&rsquo;t know whether I would use this in a core research project.</p>

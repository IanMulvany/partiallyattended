          <p>Distill is an experiment in bringing interactive documents and scholarly documents together. I&rsquo;m often asked what the future of publishing might look like, and were we to embrace what the web offers it might look like distill.</p>
<p>Two things though, make it look like a nice product. Right now paper flow into this journal is very low, and secondly they have advertised a large prize to attract work in this format. Both of these indicate that there is not a trend of organic update of people wanting to create outputs for Distill.</p>

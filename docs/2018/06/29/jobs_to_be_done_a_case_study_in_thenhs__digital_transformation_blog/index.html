          <p>This is a great post on using the jobs to be done framework. There are two specific enhancements that are discussed - how to weight those jobs, and how to use granularity of the jobs to aid the design process (less granularity gives more freedom in the design phase).</p>

<p>The authors wanted to use surveys to get a sense of importance of the under served needs, but in the end had to resort to a simple variant of card sorting. They <em>still</em> ended up with too much information.</p>

<p>One of the big powers of the job stories was in using them to situate the use case (moving from the general to the specific).</p>

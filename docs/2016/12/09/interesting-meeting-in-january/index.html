<p>There is a workshop looking at this very question happening in Oxford in early January. The morning will be a series of workshops on tools for tackling a question like the above (I&rsquo;m thinking of attending the Wikipedia and Topic Modelling workshop), and the afternoon will be a hackathon looking at some data sets.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty interesting, and a nice way to warm up to the new year. It&rsquo;s being hosted by the <a href="http://torch.ox.ac.uk/socialhumanities">The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities</a>, and you can signup on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/socialhumanities-datahack-self-representations-on-social-media-tickets-29875042055?utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=order_confirmation_email&amp;utm_term=eventname&amp;ref=eemailordconf">eventbrite</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="https://covalentdata.com/">Covalent Data</a> is a tool to search over research topics. It seems to have the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a DB of grants, papers, people and institutions.</li>
<li>claims to use machine learning to tie these entities together.</li>
<li>search results don’t seem to have a way to be exported, so for example though the grant awards results do list the amount of each grant, to get a total amount against a search term, you would need to do the work of extracting each data point manually.</li>
<li>is hard to determine what their sources are, specifically what data bases are not being covered?</li>
<li>for multi word searches the engine prefers to return “near results” than exact matches, it was quite fiddly to force exact matching in the search interface, and I&rsquo;m not convinced I was able to actually get it to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some example searches:</p>
<p>search term “Digital Humanities”.
16 results found<br>
All results are from NSF.</p>
<p>search term “computational social science”.
31 grants<br>
30 publications<br>
Again, all NSF funded grants</p>
<p>“social science” + “big data”.
90 grants.
24 publications</p>
<p>search term “stem cells”.
76k results.</p>
<p>In contrast The <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch">NSF grant search tool</a> does allow a download of results, it found the following:</p>
<p>search term “computational social science”.
13 grants</p>
<p>search term “digital humanities”.
23 grants.</p>
<p>search term “stem cells”.
632 grants.</p>
<p>I was puzzeled as to how covalent data found so many more grants for stem cells, when both NSF and NIH reported far fewer.</p>
<p>Overall I’d like to see more grant agency coverage, more clarity around how results are generated, and an export ability. I could see covalent data becoming a useful tool at some point in the future, expecially if I felt that it was taking away the pain of having to go to many different sources to find grant funding information. Right now I’m not sure I trust it, and the results, as returned, are a bit hard to work with for onward analysis.</p>

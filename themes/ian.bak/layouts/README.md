This is an example repo showing how to build up a very bare bones blog site using the https://gohugo.io static site generation tool.

There are a lot of ways to use hugo, and I this repo is an exploration of trying to get to a mostly minimally functioning blog site, choosing one of those many options.

The theme development is being done in /theme/ian

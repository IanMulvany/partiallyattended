title: Python PEP for a graph API
---
I just stumbled across this<br><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGraphApi">http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGraphApi</a>. I think it&#39;s great. The<br>discussion has actually been going on since Aug 2004, so I don&#39;t know<br>what the status of this PEP is. I would love to see something come out<br>of it eventually.<p>tags: graph, PEP, python

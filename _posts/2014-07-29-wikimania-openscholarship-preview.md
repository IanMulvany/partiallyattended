Inspired somewhat by the aweome [http://sciencetoolbox.org](http://sciencetoolbox.org), along with Martin Fenner, we proposed a session
for the upcoming Wikimania conference. We will be talking about Open Scholarship Tools on Sunday the 10th of August at 9:30 am. In our [outline](https://docs.google.com/a/elifesciences.org/document/d/133LXxlgeJfvAtUJCMdGLGKiLIhGhpnNcaJu5UX29fJc) for our talk we 
have decided to possibly think about:

- CrossRef API (and possibly also the DataCite and ORCID APIs) 
- Pandoc  
- Rstudio  
- Zotero  
- iPython Notebook  
- Plotly  
- Datawrapper  

What do you think we should try to cover in our 30 minute slot?

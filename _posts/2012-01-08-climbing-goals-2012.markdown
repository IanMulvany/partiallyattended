Well, it's been a while since I wrote up my [climbing goals for 2010][cg], and I totally missed doing this for last year, 
so as we ease our way into 2012 it's high time that I do the same again.

The key goals for 2010 were:

 * redpoint fr 7a
 * boulder V5
 * trad E1
 * some trips to do some trad climbing

Well, since then I achieved the following:

 * onsight 6c+ indoors
 * redpoint 6c outside
 * boulder V4
 * a few HVS's 

 So, not quite breaking through to where I wanted to be, but there is a feeling of definite progress.

# 2011 hi-lights:

 * font 6b, at fontainbleau 
 * 6c sport climb at Portland

Alltogether it was an OK year even though I have still not sent La Marie Rose, but if you contrast my [training diary][diary] between 2010:

and 2011:

you can see a big hole in the middle of 2011 where I took time off to refit my kitchen. The second half of 2012 will also be very distrupted from a climing point of view 
(though with some very good reasons that I am very much looking forward to). 

Today at the Castle I maanged to fire off a 6c, and 6c+, the 6c+ being on-sight. I've decided that my:

# Goals for 2012 are as follows:

 * remain injury free
 * significantly reduce the amount of alcohol that I consume
 * fall off at least 10 routes of 6c or harder/month
 * redpoint 7a, but don't stop trying harder things
 * get three campus board sessions or power hand sessions into my training per month

For the most part what I have realised is that what I have control over are the things I choose to do when I go training. If I can keep focussed on 
making sure that I don't have any anxiety about what I am trying to climb, and that I am really pushing myself and my body, then the grades and routes will
come naturally. I want to climb hard, but I don't want to set goals that will lead me to focus on that one climb, rather I want to focus on making
the journey and the process a good journey, that is using my time in a very efficient way.

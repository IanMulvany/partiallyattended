> How do people represent themselves on social media, and how are they represented by others? Which qualities and virtues are emphasized (or ignored)? How polarised are these (re)presentations?

There is a workshop looking at this very question happening in Oxford in early January. The morning will be a series of workshops on tools for tackling a question like the above (I'm thinking of attending the Wikipedia and Topic Modelling workshop), and the afternoon will be a hackathon looking at some data sets. 

It sounds pretty interesting, and a nice way to warm up to the new year. It's being hosted by the [The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities](http://torch.ox.ac.uk/socialhumanities), and you can signup on [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/socialhumanities-datahack-self-representations-on-social-media-tickets-29875042055?utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=order_confirmation_email&utm_term=eventname&ref=eemailordconf).

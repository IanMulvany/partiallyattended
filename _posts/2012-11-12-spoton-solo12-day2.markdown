Nice panel, you can see the list of the panel on the site homepage, I'll again, mostly focus on the trend of the discussion.

*What do researchers get credit for?*
	[David Shotton][ds]: getting grant applications coming in, and publications in high impact journals. He has been in hiring comittees where these are the only things that have mattered. 

	There are some dark aspects of getting credit, having a team beneath you, upon which you can place your name for their publications.

	You don't get credit for working in teams. 

	Personal referecens from people you have a good working relationhsip with. 

	We should look for concrete pieces of evidence that open beahvior has a positive effect on the kinds of measures that are being used.

	Not all of the things we are doing are measurable.

There is a bit of a discussion around tying things to ORCID, the suggestion is made to tie reviewing work from frontiers to ORCID ids. (I think we as a community can see the potential of making contributions visible, and weaving n all of these non-traditional aspects, however it will take a social shift, which is where funder mandates come in).

There is a bit of discussion around the stack overflow model. 

There is a bit of discssion around sticks, in particular the RCUK model. Why are funding agencies so polite to scientists, when they are putting in the model. The Wellcome are withholding 10% of the grant if the grantee is not OA complient. Stephen .. says he would like to see public statement disavowing the use the impact factor. 
>If you want to have other contributions considered the way to do this is to cure our addiction to the impact factor

I'll keep a partial, livish blog going during the day. I've been going to these things, I think, since about 2008. I really like these meetings. I'm going to probably keep these notes pretty lightweight. 



## [Ben Goldacre][bg] - opening keynote, on data.

Ben is talking about the issues that arise when you place a lot of data in one place. Modern tools that allow large data sets to be indexible create a new thing, a thing that not many people understand. He makes the analogy between bringing many atoms of uranium together, this creates a qualatativley different thing. Dangerous, but powerful. Data has a similar property. (We often manage to ignore the potential power that the elves at google have). He mentions the new data store on health data.

I'm going to be hosting a session at [science online London][solo] next weekend, I'm excited. I've been interested in the issues of connecting scientific data for a long time.  In the last six months I've become particularly excited about the potential of web based tool like [Yahoo Query Language][yql].  I was hoping to talk a little about that, but I've been lucky to get some amazing people to come and share their experiences about linking data, so I'm going to cede the floor to them.  I might be able to get some YQL hackery into one of the unconference slots that will be knocking around.  Science online is shaping up to be a pretty awesome event, and you can check out the [conference program][cp] to see what you will be missing out on!

Here is the spiel and speaker bios for the section that I'm going to be running:

# Connecting Scientific Resources

Do you have data? Have you decided that you want to publish that data in a friendly way? Then this session is for you. Allowing your data to be linked to other data sets is an obvious way to make your data more useful, and to contribute back to the data community that you are a part of, but the mechanics of how you do that is not always so clear cut. This session will discuss just that. With experts from the publishing world, the liked data community, and scientific data services, this is a unique opportunity to get an insight into how to create linked scientific data, and what you can do with it once you have created it.

## About the Panel ##

### Ian Mulvany, VP New Product Development, Mendeley ###
Ian Mulvany is VP of New Product Development for Mendeley.com where he is responsible for ensuring that the tools being built really respond to the needs of researchers and scientists. He spends much of his time examining the implications of emerging web technologies for the practice and communication of science, and he is excited by the untapped potential in linking and exposing data.

### Michael Habib, Product Manager, Scopus UX + Workflow ###
His specialty and passion is designing interactive and social experiences around content and metadata. Michael is currently focused on improving the Scopus user-experience by pursuing tight and seamless integration of Scopus and Scopus data (APIs, etc.) into the STM literature research workflow.

### Richard Wallis, Technology Evangelist Talis ###
As Technology Evangelist at Talis, he is at the forefront in promoting, explaining, and applying new and emerging web, semantic web and linked data technologies. Richard is a well known speaker at conferences and events, providing entertaining and informative insights in to Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web and their influence upon real world situations.

### Chris Taylor, Senior Software Engineer for Proteomics Service, EBI ###
As Senior Software Engineer, Chris plays a key role in the The Proteomics Services Team, providing databases and tools for the deposition, distribution and analysis of proteomics and proteomics-related data. The team contribute to the development of community standards for proteomics data in the context of the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI), and develop reference implementations for these standards. Chris is also involved with the isainfrastructre project, a tool to assist in the annotation and local management of experimental metadata.

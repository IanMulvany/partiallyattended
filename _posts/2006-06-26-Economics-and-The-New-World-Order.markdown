	Economics and The New World Order,
	
	I had a rather detailed and engaging conversation on Friday night
	with a couple of good friends of mine about Economics, and it's
	explanatory power. My friend Brain holds that economics explains
	everything, except perhaps for the laws of physics. Now I am
	also tempted to buy into his arguments, he is quite a persuasive fellow,
	however I intrinsically feel some caution in doing so, and I have
	been trying to figure out why.
	
	I am not sure whether my arguments hold any weight to them, or
	whether I am just being an objectionable fucker for the sake of it,
	but I'll try to lay out my thoughts here in any case. If nothing
	else, it should draw a comment from Brain pointing out the error 
	of my ways.
	
	I think the argument is that if we want to find an explanation 
	for all of the events in History, then the reason that 
	some things happened, and others didn't is that the events
	that occurred, and were successful, were the ones that had
	an economic advantage over the ones that didn't. The scope
	of what we consider, for this argument, to be economic advantage
	is quite broad. Really, it seems to be anything that gives the
	actors involved some sense of value. That sense can come from
	moral well being, from money, from realization of religious
	justification, I think. Certainly it's not simply money
	as money is just one common abstract representation of
	value. 
	 
	Now I think that I have two objections to the economic argument.
	
	The first is that it might not have any predictive power. It 
	may be tautological to say that when things happen, then
	people to whom they happen feel value,  therefore those things
	are the best fit things to happen (oh dear, that's not very clear
	at all, but this is only a blog, and so in the spirit of such
	I am not going to worry at all about not making sense). If you
	can back fit all circumstances to your explanation, either
	your explanation is very good, or it is very bad. If it adds no
	predictive power, then it's not very good. I fear that though the
	spirit of taking a truly market capitalist attitude might be 
	correct, it might also have no value. In a broad market place 
	there are many ideas that compete, but there are also 
	a huge number of factors that go to influence success. The landscape
	in which events operate (and by landscape here I mean every 
	event connected to the event under consideration that has some 
	effect on the event, weather, personal motivation, war, time
	of year, news, car accidents, and so forth). If one's position
	in the landscape has a great deal to determine whether the outcome
	of an event will be a success, then though you could argue that the
	even succeeded because economically it was best fit for it's 
	location, I think there is something wrong with that argument.
	I think that what you are looking at in economic terms is which 
	direction in the landscape you want to be heading in, however
	actually looking at the local geography of this abstract space
	may tell you more about whether you will succeed than by looking
	at where you want to go. It is not inconceivable that the 
	only thing that matters is your position in this space, and 
	not by any means your intent. The purely economic argument would then 
	be a comforting chimera that we can wrap around ourselves to 
	protect us from the vagaries of the world.
	
	That's all well and good, but is there any way to tease these idea
	apart and to test them? it's highly unlikely, but there may be some
	option not from looking at the world, but by looking at worlds that
	we create. In a simple model the economic argument should work. 
	There are many studies of what is known as the prisoners dilemma,
	I don't know much about what the studies say, but I think 
	they should be a good test of economic predictive theory.
	Therefore in a simple game economics should have a high 
	predictive power to give a winner. Add complexity to the 
	game and see how predictability changes as a rate of increasing
	complexity. Hmm, actually, the stock market is a very good 
	example of doing something like this, but we can't reverse 
	engineer the world to see if we can make it more predictable.
	
	Well, that was part one of my argument, which even I have to admit
	just comes down to saying "perhaps things are just a bit more complicated",
	and since we all seek simplicity, then perhaps there is not 
	much harm in looking to economics (other than being wrong an awful
	lot, and retroactively fitting by saying, ahh, but of course we didn't
	factor in economic driver blah blah). Still, it's in our
	nature to be wrong loving mammals, so I shouldn't worry too much.
	
	The next thing that unsettles me is even if the economic argument
	it is wright, and it would be quite nice if it were right, for if
	it were it would give us the true power to change the world, 
	there may be a temptation to confuse correctness of explanation
	with justification for action. Being Irish I have a built-in
	distrust of a lazzaiz-fair market, as this was the decision
	that contributed to the deaths of many Irish people during the 
	great famine of the 1840's. By saying that the open market
	is the best option we forgo our ability to intervene when there
	is pressing reason to do so. The best open market for ideas
	is evolution, but even in evolution market forces can press
	species into extinction, though sexual over-selection. The
	same may be happening with America where there is a strong
	market drive for light entertainment, cheap credit and cheap oil.
	Perhaps these drivers are acting locally and may not be the
	best actions that the market could be taking locally. Even though
	humans are subject to evolution I believe strongly that we have
	the capacity to transcend evolution (that sounds wishy-washy, but
	I mean that we have the moral and technological ability to make decisions
	that are nut just driven by competition with other species, indeed
	our ability to do so almost gives us a moral obligation to do so, 
	and that would be fine, as soon as we figure out what morals are).
	
	Well, I have more to say, but for the time being that is enough on this topic 
	from me.

Today I'm at the STM innovations seminar. The twitter tag for today is [#ukinno](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ukinno&src=typd). The program is [online](http://www.stm-assoc.org/events/innovations-seminar-2013/).

I'm going to take a light approach to blogging today, I'll probably hang out mostly on Twitter. I'll fix up the spelling later. 


## 9.35 The Research Data Revolution, Sayeed Choudhury, Associate Dean for Research Data Management,
Johns Hopkins University 
> Data has become a major topic of interest from all sectors of society with headlines such as “Data is the new oil” to assertions from McKinsey that data is the fourth factor of production. Within higher education, new forms of data intensive scholarship have already begun to transform research and learning. The “Research Data Revolution” will examine the implications of these developments for libraries and publishers especially as they relate to new forms of competition.

Sayeed is talking about data in general, he is associated with [http://dataconservancy.org](http://dataconservancy.org).

Some key points from his talk.

- data is the new Oil
- data has to be made open and actionable by machines
- from the libraries perspective, data are a new form of collections 
- treat manuscripts like a dataset, even humanists are starting to see new possabilites and new methods, creating a completely new experience online. 
- as librarians, think about the realtionship you can have with your communities, if they start to manage and curate the data, this leads to an opportunity for creating new relationships built around those special collections. 

Nice take on `Big Data`. If a community is overwhelme by it's data, then the data becomes big. For the Astronomers today the SDSS is no longer big - 150TB, as the astronomers now have tools to deal with this data. New proposed experiments are creating data that will overwhelm the field, lead to a situation in which most of the data will have to be thrown away on first run. 

He makes the point of needing to know the provenonce of data, how data moves from one fromat to another. I'm a big fan now of making this available in code, via automated tool chains such as [chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) and [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com). 

If data collections become open, no one is going to care about how much data you have, in contrast to the services that you provide. Some services may be hard to run across the network, but generally libraries and publishers might differentiate themselves via the servcies they offer, rather than as acting as gatekeepers to the content. We need to get serious about machine based services to the content. There will be some things that only humans can do. 

Mentions a seminal report on the dynamics of infrastrucure developement. (you can find a copy online from [UMich](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/49353/UnderstandingInfrastructure2007.pdf?sequence=3) - open access FTW!). The conclusion from the reoprt is that we will need new forms of infrastrucutre. Que story about stupid machines and reccomendation engines going wrong, but the machine corrected itself quickly. 

Google and Amazon have figured out that at scale even dumb machines can do well. That is why scale is important. It's a means, but not an end. At Hopkins they have one large astronomy dataset, but there are many other astronomy data sets out there. They have to think of services across all of those data sets, not just on one data set. The scale will allow machines to appear to be clever, and this is where the role of the expert will remain important. 

The discussion moves on to curation of data, and who is doing a good job. He mentions [http://schema.org](http://schema.org), mentions that top 5 places that do data management are Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon. Big question, are these pople doing the creation of these knowledge graphs with a view to preservation. The answer is proabaly not. The informaiton graphs that are coming out of the librarian community - OAE-ORE - are richer, smaller, are not incompatable with Schema.org, but at the moment they have no skin the the game, they have to offer something. (I didn't really get the point here).

Publising is about content and not format

Question time, but I'm probably not going to capture the Q&A session.

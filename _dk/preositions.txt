Prepositions

For some odd reason prepositions also decide which case the sentence is
going to be in!

Dative preposiions:
		these prepositions infer a change of some type. the
		subject is in the process of 'becomng' or altering its
		relationship with the fixt Newtonian idea. These are
		more "Einsteinian" sorts of preositions. 
	ab	
	aus			out (out of)
	bei			next to
	gegenuber von		?
	mit			with
	nach			from
	seit			since
	von			from
	zu			to
	
Acccusative and Dative prepositions:
		These are concerned with purely spatial relationships.
		These can best be thought of as describing unchanging
		spatial relationships!

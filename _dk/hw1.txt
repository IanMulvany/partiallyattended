describing someone

a description. that is what we are looking for. The face of things. The
apperance. Let me tell you. When I close my eyes a face comes to me.
It still comes into my mind, after so many years. This river of time
that i have floated in, has brought me across continents, it has
opened doors, found lovers, left me poor, rich, happy. It has left me
with my life hanging by a thread, left me drugged, drunk and in all
manners of firghtful sobriety, but it has not let me leave that face
behind. 

i must have been a child. i must have known very little about the world.
you could call me an innocent. I was in the garden of a neighbour. A big
garden. You could squeeze between the at the back alley. 

Ein description. Fur Das ist was wir suchen. Die geschit uberall. Die
weltposition.

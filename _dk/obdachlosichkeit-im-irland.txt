In addition to the modern problem, the issue of homelessness in Ireland has an historic place in the mind of the nation. 
This comes from the famine of mid 1800's. 

A population of 8 million people was reduced to only 4 million over a period of 40 years. Most of the population
of Ireland were small farmers, growing and living off of potatos. The cause of the famine was a 
potato blight. The potato crops failed year after year and about one and a half million people died from hunger.  
Many of the rest of the small farmers were not able to make enough money to pay ther rent, and they were made homeless.
With not homes, no future and limited options over two million people emigrated. The homeless irish scatterd across the world, and a small island went on to have a big cultural impact across the world. 

Modern homlessness is much the same as that in many western european countries. The root causes are mix of poverty, substance abuse and 
individuals suffering from mental instability who slip through the medical safetey net. But it is becoming a growing problem. This is related to changing demographics of the country. 

The population of the Ireland has never recovered since the time of the famine. That makes Ireland the least populated country in Europe as a function of it's size. For all of it's history Ireland's population has been mostly rural. 

In the early 1990s, or the first time in the countries hitory more than half of the population lived in cities. Homlesness affects both rural and town communities, but there is more of it in cities. As a result it has been a growing problem in Ireland.

The recent collape of the economy, with unemployment jumping from an historic low of 4% in 2000 to over 14% in 2010 means that many more people are falling into poverty. The outlook for homlessness in Ireland is bleak.

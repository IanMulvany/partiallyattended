I'm [Ian Mulvany][me], I'm VP of new product development for [Mendeley.com][mendeley]. 

This blog represents my personal opinion, and not that of my employer. 

This blog is generated using the [jekyll][jekyll] templating engine, and it is hosted on [github][github]. The design has been very gratefully lifted from the very talented [Matt Foster][matt], and the background image was taken at the Alhambra. 

Pages are generated using github's [pages][gp] mechanism.
